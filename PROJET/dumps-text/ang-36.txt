   Tasting Kolkata's famous egg roll
   By Justin Rowlatt
   South Asia correspondent

   The Kolkata egg roll speaks volumes about the real nature of the
   eastern Indian city that devours this tasty snack at every opportunity.

   You'll have heard the expression "we are what we eat", but the egg roll
   suggests it would be more accurate to say we eat what we are.

   Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, was once the greatest port city on
   earth.

   It was the pivot-point of a crucial moment in world history, the moment
   the flow of wealth from west to east was reversed.

   Since Roman times, Europe had always been what historian Nick Robins
   calls "Asia's commercial supplicant". It shipped out gold and silver in
   return for spices, textiles and luxury goods.

   This is the 17th article in a BBC series India on a plate, on the
   diversity and vibrancy of Indian food. Other stories in the series:

   Then, in the middle of the 18th Century, that flow stalled and wealth
   started moving the other way, first a trickle, very soon a cascade.

   The now infamous East India Company had begun to take advantage of the
   decline of the Mughal Empire, and was extending its control beyond
   Calcutta, deep into India itself.

   The city mushroomed as workers poured in to man the increasingly busy
   docks.

   It was hard labour. The marshy riverbank on a bend of the Hooghly river
   where the company had put down its roots 150 years earlier is still hot
   and humid.

   The egg roll evolved to sate the appetite of these men.

   I don't mean to do down my homeland, but in Britain an egg roll is just
   that, an egg in a roll.

   In India an egg roll - a street food even the poorest inhabitants of
   the city can afford - is something far more luxurious and delicious.

   Watch as a paratha, a slim disc of unleavened bread baked on a hot pan,
   is fried with a couple of eggs. This is your canvas.

   Now see it piled with salad: sliced cucumber, carrot, onion - possibly
   tomatoes and red or green pepper too. There'll be a sprinkle of chopped
   chilli, a dash of mustard oil and maybe a dusting of black pepper.

Divisive ingredient

   Then there'll be a pinch of the most divisive of all Indian ingredients
   - kala namak, or black salt.

   Black salt is a dark-coloured rock salt with a distinctive sulphurous
   flavour. Indians like it so much they add it to all sorts of foods and
   drinks - there's even a popular boiled sweet flavoured with kala namak.

   Whether you like black salt is the real barometer of how deep you've
   dived into Indian cuisine. I hated it when I first came to India but,
   more than a year in, I'm slowly coming round to it.

   So don't let the black salt put you off.

   Egg roll stalls offer unlimited supplies of fresh lime, chilli sauce
   and tomato ketchup to stifle the flavour with, should you wish to.

   Like Kolkata, the egg roll is a formidable dish. I once had two for
   lunch and didn't need to eat again for 18 hours.

   But Calcutta's dockers were working a lot harder than me. Around 250
   years ago, the Hooghly was choked with tall ships.

   "We still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase
   disguises a more sinister reality," writes historian William Dalrymple.

   "It was not the British government that seized India at the end of the
   18th Century, but a dangerously unregulated private company
   headquartered in one small office, five windows wide, in London, and
   managed in India by an unstable sociopath - Clive."

   Clive is Robert Clive, then governor of Bengal and head of the East
   India Company's operations in India.

   The year 1765 was decisive. That's when Clive, whose portrait still
   hangs in the British High Commissioner's residence in Delhi, wrested
   the right to raise taxes in Bengal from the Mughal emperor, Shah Alam.

Impoverishing Bengal

   Within five years the company - answerable only to its shareholders,
   remember - had trebled the tax take, impoverishing the people of Bengal
   and helping cause one of the worst famines the world has ever seen.

   A third of the population of Bengal - 10 million people - died, while
   the company, ever mindful of its bottom line, actually increased tax
   collection.

   Along the way Clive acquired a vast personal fortune, but told a House
   of Commons inquiry into corruption he was "astounded" at his own
   moderation.

   Meanwhile India, which is reckoned to have accounted for a quarter of
   global manufacturing when British traders first arrived at the
   beginning of the 17th Century, saw its riches drained away to the East
   India Company's London HQ and its markets flooded with British
   products.

   At the beginning of the 20th century, India was responsible for just 3%
   of world GDP.

   No wonder it has been dubbed the "unrequited trade".

   But now the flow of wealth is changing direction again: the balance of
   world trade has been tilting back in favour of the east. And Kolkata is
   changing too.

   Buy an egg roll from one of the stalls by the bus station opposite the
   boulevard of now crumbling colonial buildings in the centre of town.

   As you eat, start to walk though the city.

   The extravagant legacies of imperial power soon give way to a more
   modern metropolis. There is still poverty here, but as elsewhere in
   India, there are new buildings, new industries and new hope.

   The great intellectual tradition of the city lives on in the bookshops
   and cafes.

   And the egg roll continues to thrive too, still providing solid
   sustenance to the dockers' hard working descendants, even if they are
   now more likely to be hunched over a computer screen than carrying
   sacks by the Hooghly.
