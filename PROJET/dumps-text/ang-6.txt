   Chains like McDonald's stand out for how successfully they have adapted
   their products to India

   For decades, global fast food giants have been catering to Indians used
   to eating from local eateries. In recent years, they have moved towards
   fusion of regional flavours. The BBC's Zoya Mateen and Meryl Sebastian
   report.

   Western fast-food was a novelty when McDonald's opened its first outlet
   in an upscale Delhi neighbourhood in 1996.

   But the chain persisted, reinventing itself by tailoring its menu to
   local tastes.

   So, there was mayonnaise made without eggs, meat patties without pork
   and beef. There was a palette of bold Indian flavours which found
   expression in a unique vegetarian spread: McAloo Tikki (a tangy burger
   made out of potatoes and peas), Pizza McPuff (a calzone-like sandwich
   stuffed with pizza toppings and cheese), and spicy wraps made from
   cottage cheese.

   In no time, the burger had gone national.

   The company's trademark golden logo became a ubiquitous presence across
   cities and its catchy jingle - 'I'm lovin it' - a reminder of the good
   times for many.

   McDonald's has become a template for American fast food chains that are
   constantly localising their menus in a bid to dominate the Indian
   market. The result: a range of offerings that are so liberally
   flavoured with Indian spices that they bear little resemblance to the
   original western counterpart.

   "McDonald's, KFC and Domino's stand out for how successfully they have
   adapted their products to India, even at a regional level," says Arvind
   Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a consultancy firm.

   India is no stranger to a fusion of flavours in its food.

   This ranges from crushing papadam (a thin, crisp flatbread) into a
   portion of payasam (a sweet rice pudding) in the southern state of
   Kerala to sprinkling chilli powder on guava ice cream from the famed
   Apsara Ice Creams in the city of Mumbai.

   International brands tweak their products to reach a large audience in
   India, adding more spices in case of salted foods or making sweets
   sweeter than how they may be preferred in Europe, Mr Singhal says.

   "In the 1980s, Nestle came out with a ketchup variant under their Maggi
   brand that was 'hot & spicy' and it became an instant hit," Mr Singhal
   says. "Likewise, with Maggi noodles came out with a wide range of
   flavouring sachets to appeal to a wider but highly heterogeneous group
   of Indian consumers."

   But in recent years, brands have moved towards experimenting with more
   and more unusual combinations in their food.

   Snickers has introduced a kesar pista - saffron and pistachio that is
   central to traditional Indian sweets - flavour of its iconic
   chocolate-nougat bar. Dunkin has launched its own thandai, a chilled
   sweetened milk drink garnished with dry fruits, rose petals and
   saffron. And McDonald's has incorporated butter chicken - a popular
   sweet and spicy roast chicken preparation - into its burgers.

   Homegrown brands like Bira have also jumped on the fusion bandwagon,
   offering a mango flavoured lassi (a sweet-sour yogurt beverage)
   milkshake beer.

   Some of the fusion food is also performative though, done to satisfy a
   market need.

   "Unusual food combinations go viral when they are covered by food
   bloggers and it gives a brand visibility," says Karan Dua, who runs the
   popular YouTube channel Dil Se Foodie, or Foodie by Heart.

   But new-fangled customisations can be tedious in a country where
   there's a local substitute for everything and cuisines are part of a
   larger culture.

   Thinking burgers? There's vada, or greasy doughnuts, piping hot and so
   spicy that eating them can be an extraordinary feat of gastronomic
   endurance.

   Fancy a popcorn? How about bhel poori instead, a crispy rice snack even
   that Bollywood celebrities swear by its health benefits.

   Not to forget the iconic momo, or steamed dumpling, which has fast
   become the culinary lodestar of the local fast-food scene.

   Mr Dua says that things get trickier at regional level, where tastes
   and food habits can change at every bend of the road.

   Last year, in Surat city in western India, he tried a fruit tea - a
   combination of cut fruits and milky tea. In another part of the state,
   he recalls seeing a store whose popular item included an ice cream
   sandwich with slabs of cheese and butter.

   "In Gujarat, people are used to mixing savoury with sweet in their food
   and so these combinations are quite common and popular there. But it'd
   be a hard sell in a city like Delhi," he says.

   But fast-foods are only one end of the spectrum.

   When Pooja Dhingra opened her iconic French patisserie, Le15, in south
   Mumbai, her plan was simple: she wanted to use French techniques and
   Indian flavours.

   This led to many fun flavour combinations - paan (betel leaves)
   macarons, chai or tea cupcakes, and green chilli truffles to name a
   few. As her menu received glowing reviews, she began experimenting
   further, often using her parents as guinea pigs for trials of new
   flavours.

   "I've always found it useful to look at my culture and life experiences
   to create menus. Some of it can be disastrous - like a kala khatta
   macaron that never worked! - but it can also be wonderful."

   Once food has the personality and experiences of the chef, Ms Dhingra
   adds, marketing it is a lot easier too.

   "My favourite thing to do is to plan our Diwali menu which is always
   the best of the French and Indian world," she says. "Our kaju katli
   macaron is a huge hit and this year I'm excited to incorporate the
   besan laddu on my menu - with a French twist of course!"
