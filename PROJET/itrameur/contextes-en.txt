Street food

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Ready-to-eat food or drink on a street

   Street food is ready-to-eat food or drinks sold by a hawker, or vendor,
   in a street or at other public places, such as markets or fairs. It is
   often sold from a portable food booth,^[1] food cart, or food truck and
   is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but
   many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are
   classified as both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper
   than restaurant meals. The types of street food widely vary between
   regions and cultures in different countries around the world.^[2]
   According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization,
   2.5 billion people eat street food every day.^[3] A majority of
   middle-income consumers^[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service
   of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in
   developing countries.

   Today, governments and other organizations are increasingly concerned
   with both the socioeconomic importance of street food, and with its
   associated risks. These risks include food safety, sanitation issues,
   illegal use of public or private areas, social problems and traffic

   The presence of street food vendors in New York City throughout much of
   its history, such as these circa 1906, are credited with helping
   support the city's rapid growth.

Europe[edit]

   In ancient Greece, small fried fish was a street food,^[5] however, the
   Greek philosopher Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low
   regard.^[6] Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was
   discovered during the excavation of Pompeii.^[7] Street food was widely
   consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes
   did not have ovens or hearths.^[8] Chickpea soup^[9] with bread and
   grain paste^[10] were common meals. In ancient China, street food
   generally catered to the poor, though wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their
   homes.^[8]

   meat," including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted.^[11] In
   1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and
   standardize street food.^[12]

   In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold
   gingerbread nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other
   meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside.^[13] French
   fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a
   street food in Paris in the 1840s.^[14] Street foods in Victorian
   London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and
   jellied eels.^[15]

   During the American Colonial period, "street vendors sold oysters,
   roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes."
   Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until
   around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise.^[20]
   Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After
   previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food
   vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707.^[21] Many
   women of African descent made their living selling street foods in
--
   fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines and
   other sweets in New Orleans.^[22] Cracker Jack started as one of many
   street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.^[23]

Asia[edit]

   The selling of street food in China stretches back millennia and became
   an integral part of Chinese food culture during the Tang Dynasty.
   Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with
   regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary
   tourism.^[24] Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has
   had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced
   the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street
   food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers
   imported from China during the late 19th century.^[25]

   Ramen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100
   years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However,
   it soon became a "national dish" and even acquired regional
   variations.^[26]

   Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of
   Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the
   early 1960s,^[27] when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the
   street food culture, and by the 1970s it had "displaced
   home-cooking."^[28] As a result, many Thai street foods are derived
   from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine.^[29] About 76% of urban
   residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of
   the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity
   of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone
   generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee,
   Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects
   the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually
   from 2020 forward.^[30] Multiple studies showed that contamination of
   food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the
   contamination at restaurants.^[31] An estimated 2% or 160,000 vendors
   provide street food for Bangkok's 8 million people.^[32]

   In Delhi, India, it is said that ugh kings used to visit the kebab
   vendors on the street, which you can still visit to this day. During
   the colonial times, fusion street food was created, which was made with
   British customers in mind.^[33]

   During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several
   street food were developed and documented, including satay and dawet
   (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's
   vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization
   in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service
   sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban

   Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly
   between regions and cultures.^[2]

   Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being "fresh
   and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing]
   heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of
   Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste and fish
   sauce."^[35] Street food in Thailand offers a varied selection of
   ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks. The capital of Thailand,
   Bangkok, has been listed as one of the best places for street

   curries and mango sticky rice.

   Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese,
   and Dutch influences.^[38] Indonesian street food is often strongly
   flavored and spicy. Much of the street food in Indonesia is fried, such
   as fritters, nasi goreng and ayam goreng. Bakso (meatball soup), satay
   (skewered chicken) and gado-gado (vegetable salad served in peanut

   Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its
   own specialities to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes
   are vada pav, misal pav, chole bhature, parathas, bhel puri, sev puri,
   gol gappa, aloo tikki, kebabs, tandoori chicken, samosas, kachori,
   idli, pohe, egg bhurji, pav bhaji, pulaw, pakora, lassi, kulfi and
   falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly
   known as nukkadwala food ("corner" food). In South India, foods like
   mirchi bajji, punugulu, and mokkajonna (corn roasted on coal) are

   bonda. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to
   sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken their
   inspiration from the street food of India.^[40]

   Mexican street food is known as antojitos (translated as "little

   New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, but New York
   street food also includes everything from spicy Middle Eastern falafel
   or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles ^[35]

   In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of "plate lunch" (rice,
   macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the
   Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.^[43]
--
   the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally
   created and run vary in different areas of the world.^[44] Often,
   women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender
   equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street
   vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street
   food trade.^[45] Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes
   towards meals is one "cultural factor operating in the street food
   phenomenon" in the Philippines because eating "food out in the open, in
   the market or street or field" is "not at odds with the meal indoors or
   at home" where "there is no special room for dining".^[13]

   Other cultural phenomena that affect the street food market include the
   cultural implications of eating while walking down the street. In some
   cultures, this is considered to be rude,^[46] such as Japanese^[47] or
--
   non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.^[49]

   In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce
   economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors
   purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the
   area have expanded.^[50] In the United States, street food vendors are
   credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying
   meals for the city's merchants and workers.^[51] Proprietors of street

   Since 1984, Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco is home of one of the
   most diverse street food fairs.^[54] In addition to much leather, and
   people in various states of dress and undress, the event features an
   outdoor food court serving a variety of street food. For donations of
   $10 or more, visitors get a $2 discount on each drink purchased at the
   fair. In 2018, the street photographer Michael Rababy documented it in
   his book, Folsom Street Food Court.^[54]^[55]

   Netflix has also featured the street foods of the world through its TV
   series Street Food, with the first volume focusing on Asia, and the
   second on Latin America.^[56]^[57]^[58]

Health and safety[edit]

   As early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food
   vendor activities.^[11] With the increasing pace of globalization and
   tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns
   of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise
   public awareness.^[59]^[60]^[61] However, despite concerns about
   contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low,
   with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.^[43]

   In Singapore, street food vendors known as "hawkers", over half of
   which were unlicensed, were considered "primarily a nuisance to be
   removed from the streets".^[62] 113 hawker centres were constructed

   In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided
   comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and
   retailers of the street food sector since 2000.^[65] Other effective
   ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping
   programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing

   is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in
   tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up
   studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and
   food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been
   devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness.

The rise and rise of the fast food industry

   Portion size to calorie intake, study sheds light on how fast food is
   causing various lifestyle diseases
     [plus.png]
--
   However, according to a study, by Boston University and Tufts
   University, comparison between the portion size and calorie intake from
   fast food, between 1986 and 2016, shows a drastic increase in all the
   parameters.

   However, there has been an increase in levels of calcium and iron,
   especially in desserts, according to the study that looked at fast food
   brands like, McDonald’s, Dairy Queen and KFC. On average per decade,
   the daily value of calcium increased by 3.9 per cent in desserts and

   Even though this rise could be good for treating anaemia and calcium
   deficiency, “people should not be consuming fast food to get more
   calcium and iron in their diet because of the high calories and sodium
   that come along with it,” Megan McCrory, lead author of the study, was

   It assumes importance as nearly 36 per cent of adults in the US consume

   restaurant menus grew a staggering 226 per cent, an average of 22.9
   items per year. Along with the menu expansions, researchers found that

   as saying.

   Advent of fast food in India

   In India, increase in disposable income has in turn increased the
   frequency of dinning out. Big fast food chains like McDonald’s came to
   India in 1996, and soon other big outlets like Dominos, Pizza Hut, KFC,
   etc, followed suit, according to a study by AIIMS, Bangalore.

   According to another report, Indian fast food market is expected to
   grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent by 2020 due
   to changing consumer behaviour and demography.

   This indicates that India is sailing in the same boat as US when it
   comes to fast food consumption. The latest findings should be taken as
   a benchmark and, we should work towards cutting down the fast food
   consumption in order to lead a healthy life.

Fast Food Onslaught on Culinary Culture

   It is easy to laugh and shrug off the above anecdote, but in reality,
   it is no laughing matter. It speaks volumes about how fast food has

   foods and the link between fast food and weight gain or obesity.

Traditional food better than Fast Food

   [This thread wins a special prize for the TOW May 4th -10th]
   Do you think traditional is food better than fast food? How?
   Generally food prepared at home is hygienic and healthy. The results of
   recent food surveys show that people are more addicted to fast food
   than our Indian traditional food items. This is well-known by the
   increasing number of McDonald, KFC fast foods.

   Agree. Fast food has following problem. Fast food is expensive. Fast
   food has no personal touch and looks and tastes like factory food.

   Fast food joints helps the lazy who have their 'hands tied' by busyness
   of work culture. They crumble all that is served without a iota of care

Fast food the Indian way

   McSpicy &amp; McVeggie

   Almost every time we think about Fast Food, American chain restaurants
   come to mind. Fast food restaurants have been springing up across the
   world for decades now and are an integral part of the culinary scene in
   most countries. In India, the fast food industry has had a hard time
   getting going because most people had their own way of cooking and were
   not ready to change their habits. But nowadays, the industry is growing
   rapidly as more and more people (especially among the youth) become
   passionate about fast food.

   up, added more vegetarian options and adapted their prices to the
   population’s regular cost of living. Certainly, Indians have developed
   a taste for western-style fast food but they have different
   sensitivities so the chains have to  “Indianise”  themselves.

--
   That’s all very well and thoughtful but people might wonder why they
   should eat spiced up versions of western food when they have Indian
   fast food offering Asian dishes. Indeed, reviews of the McSpicy suggest
   that it is not that spicy for the Indian palette.  So what about
   home-grown alternatives?

   Traditionally in India, fast food can be found on the road side and
   most of the outlets in India are independent establishments not chains
   or franchises.

Post Highlight

   Street food is a great option if you want to cook your food and have it
   delivered to your door. Owning a restaurant has its perks over the
   street food business. However, the owners of both fields must be aware
   of the perks associated with each business. #ThinkWithNiche

--

   If you’re running a restaurant, you might be thinking about how to make
   the most of your profits. Street food, on the other hand, is a great
   option for people who want to cook their food and have it delivered to
   their customers. However, restaurant owners should be aware that there
   are several benefits to cooking street food instead of going to a
   restaurant. For one, restaurants can often cost more than cooking food
   from scratch. Additionally, restaurants can be difficult to manage and
--
   cooked from scratch.

   Why Street Food is Better than Restaurant Food

   While you should keep some of the advantages of a restaurant like a
   convenience and quality of food, you should be aware that there are
   several reasons why street food is better than restaurant food.

    It’s affordable!

   One of the biggest advantages of street food is its affordability. You
   can often buy a dozen eggs or meatballs at your local market for less
   than $5. Additionally, people can eat street food at their own kitchen
   table rather than spending money on expensive seats or tables. It is
   means that the cost per person is generally less than a sit-down meal
   at a restaurant if you're strictly cooking from scratch.

   The Different Types of Street Food

   Street food differs from other types of food in that it’s usually
   cooked at street level, not at a restaurant. It is typically served
   with little or no preparation and doesn’t require refrigeration.

   For example, you might be able to find street food like tacos,
   burritos, and tamales at a local taco stand or a local convenience
   store. You can also buy street food at a local grocery store or deliver
   fresh ingredients to your home. Though you may have noticed that some
   of these foods are called “street food” or “fast food.” It is actually
   the wrong name. Street foods are often sold for a higher price than
   fast foods because they are prepared directly on the premises using
--
   serve these items as regularly as fast foods.

   How to Cook Street Food the Right Way

   If you cook your own food, you know exactly what ingredients go into it
--
   and how to prepare it. But that doesn’t mean that you need to buy a
   bunch of expensive ingredients. You can easily save money on your menu
   and ingredients by cooking street food. You don’t have to eat at
   restaurants all the time. If you’re thinking about running a
   restaurant, there are plenty of options out there — fast food joints
   and coffee shops are just a couple of choices. However, if you want to
   cook at home instead of going out, it pays off in many different ways!

   There were challenges in entering the market. Based on McDonald’s
   survey on the Indian market, they learned that Indians wanted to try
   and taste American fast food, however, it should not be a replacement
   for their food. Therefore, McDonald’s need to adapt to Indian taste if
   they want to succeed in India. They had to customize their burgers to

   There is plenty of existing competition in the Indian fast food space.
   McDonald’s has had to compete with a range of alternatives to maintain
   control of the Indian market. India’s street food, for example, has
   many forms and varieties, and it’s very popular amongst Indian people.

--


   Fast food is very popular in India. What’s more, India’s fast food
   industry is growing quickly. It’s now at 40% per annum, generating over
   Rs. 4800 cores in sales and over Rs. 7000 cores in multinational

   There are also unique varieties of fast food in different states of
   India which can be difficult to serve well and are generally much
   cheaper than a McDonald’s meal. For example, the most authentic cuisine
   is Indian street food and can be bought for a few rupees from portable
   stalls found in the Indian cities and towns.

--


   Take-out food, fast food, and snacks are easily available which is
   another factor undermining McDonald’s convenience offer. It doesn’t
   take much time to prepare street food either, so vendors present a very
   convenient and tasty eating option.

   They introduced a burger called Aloo Tikki Burger for 20 rupees (20p).

   Indian spices. This is McDonald’s India version of street food. It was
   a hit – with the taste, value and price they introduced to the market.
   It radically changed India’s industry.

       India that has also become McDonald’s competitors, McDonald’s did
       not back out but instead doubled its efforts to build its position

   Indian street food is popular across the globe for its diversity, spicy
   flavour and amazing taste. Some popular street dishes found in
   different cities of India are Aloo Tikki, Chaat, Pani Puri/Gol Gappe,
--

   You can visit any Indian restaurant in any part of the world to satisfy
   your craving for scrumptious Indian street food that’s likely to
   tantalise your tongue in no time.

What is Indian Street Food?

   Indian street food is often made of a medley of various seasoned
   ingredients, flavourful spices, fresh vegetables, and sweet &amp; sour
   sauces.
--
   People in different parts of the world are also building an appetite
   for these foods. That’s why it’s not difficult to find a good Indian
   restaurant offering traditional Indian street food in various parts of
   the world.

--
   types of food lovers.

Is Indian Street Food Healthy?

   A mere mention of Indian street food can easily make mouths water just
   on hearing its name. However, many people still stay away from street
   food, as it falls into the category of junk food.

   However, the truth is that if you go to any good Indian restaurant, you
   get a variety of dishes to choose from. Many street food varieties are
   indeed devoid of significant health benefits and essential nutrients.

   But some Indian street food dishes may not necessarily include in the
   list of foods to avoid. Moreover, a wide selection of this food variety
   is quite healthy. This is because Indian street food variety available
   in restaurants is prepared with fresh ingredients and different spices
   that are known to be beneficial for health.

   We won’t say that Indian street food is healthy. But if prepared with
   freshly cooked vegetables and other health-benefiting spices in a
   sanitized restaurant kitchen, it can be quite a safe and healthy option
--
   While you can choose from a wide variety of Indian street foods, some
   dishes are so delicious that you cannot miss tasting them. Here is a
   list of the popular street food that must go global:

1. Aloo Tikki
--

   Bhelpuri is a blast of different flavours in your mouth. It is a West
   Indian street food item that combines salty, sweet and spicy flavours
   in the form of one delicious snack. It is also a vegan dish and
   traditionally served in a simple paper cone.
--
   Chaat

   It is another common Indian street food that’s mostly found in
   different regions of North India. However, chaat is a term used
   generally for South Asian street food. Many people in the world are
   fond of Indian Chaat.

--

   Pani puri is also known as gol gappa, gup chup and puchka in different
   parts of India. It is the most popular Indian street food, which not
   only Indians love but many foreigners as well.

--
Conclusion

   One of the best things about Indian street food is that it’s easily
   accessible in almost any region in India. With the popularity of Indian
   restaurants in the world, people living in foreign lands can also enjoy
   the taste of different flavourful and spicy Indian street food dishes.

   The reason why Indian street food must become popular across the globe
   is that it’s delicious, which is quite evident from the rush of crowds
   gathering to eat any Indian dish. Furthermore, Indian street food is
   affordable and hence, ideal for those travellers who are on a budget.

   Examples of fast food (left to right, top to bottom): Cheeseburger,
   soft drink, french fries, pizza margherita, hot dog, fried chicken,
   submarine sandwich, and donuts.

   Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial
   resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a
   commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with
   frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for
   take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to
   accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
   workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570
   billion globally.^[1]

   The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which
   reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
   primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
   pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef

   Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the
   drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no
   shelter or seating,^[2] or fast food restaurants (also known as quick
   service restaurants).^[3] Franchise operations that are part of
   restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each

   Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and
   calories.^[5] Fast food has been linked to increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol,
   insulin resistance conditions and depression.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding
   lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast food
   consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.^[11]

   The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with

   and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family
   dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway
   fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is
   getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47
   minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes

   own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers,
   many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus
   relied on fast food. Travelers such as pilgrims en route to a holy

   A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the
   fish and chip shop and fast food industries.^[21] As a cheap fast food
   served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the
   Victorian working classes.^[21] By 1910, there were more than 25,000
   fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more
   than 35,000 shops.^[22] Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain
   opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in
   1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish
   and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.^[23]

   British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the
   regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective
   area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of
   fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl
   commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used
   more frequently in fast food.^[24] The UK has adopted fast food from
   other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More
   recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also
   emerged.

   propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are

   Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers that promise

--
   from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

   Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on
   the go," often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a
   finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and
   chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries,
   onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream,
   though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like chili,
   mashed potatoes, and salads.

Basic Differences Between Indian Street Food &amp; Fast Food

   large-image large-image
--
   The journey of buying cooked food for consumption began centuries ago
   and today, it is a normal practice. Well, we are here to discuss two
   types of bites available in the market. Street food and fast food. More
   specifically Indian street food and fast food because this blog is for
   everyone who thinks they are one and the same thing! No. There are many
   facets between them.
--

   Coming back to our topic, the fundamental difference between street
   food and fast food is the way one prepares it. Fast food is anything
   that’s made by bringing pre-cooked condiments together to make the
   final item. Whereas, street food is anything that’s cooked on the spot
   with raw ingredients. Read on to learn more about both of these food
   types.

Top 3 Differences Between Street Food &amp; Fast Food

   Many believe that Street Food is the same as Fast Food. Well, you can
   say that because both of these edibles are made and served within
   moments. But they are poles apart, and here’s how.
--
   1) Composition

   Fast food has high quantities of refined sugar, complex fat, and
   carbohydrates. The combination of all this, though pleasing, can cause
   grave complications in the future. On the other hand, street food, more
   specifically, Indian street food, contains fresh veggies, beneficial
   spices, and the least amount of processed products. It is the ideal
   quick bite for people watching their weight.

   We are living in times where having a healthy immune system is of
   utmost importance. Fast food does provide momentary satisfaction, but
   street food provides contentment with medical perks. In the case of
   EggHolic, the menu is curated keeping all necessary parameters in mind.
   Every platter, be it egg, paneer, or chicken-based offers great taste.
--
   3) The Diversity Factor

   Finally, the range of platters available in the Street Food section is
   vastly more than the Fast Food section. Be it the US or Canada, busy
   roads are full of vendors offering the same type of edibles with a few
   twists. The bread, butter, and cheese with something to complement. But
   street food, again, Indian street food has varieties that will leave
   you surprised.

   India is known for its “university in diversity”, and so is visible in
   its street food options. The EggHolic Menu has platters from all parts
   of the country and we are adding more to the group as time passes.
   There’s no end to it! There is a perception of street food as a place
   where new foods can be explored with an authentic and homemade feel.
   Check out our menu to see all you can have at the Indian restaurant in
   Brampton, Canada. Here are a few best-sellers.

Fast Food Culture and Industrialization

   Meena Chetty

   Because of weaker food and drug regulations, along with the expansion
   of the fast food industry, India’s population of obese individuals is
   increasing. India is the third most obese country in the world, with
   more than 3% of its population facing obesity according to Obesity
   Foundation India.<lt;sup>gt;2<lt;/sup>gt;  This trend is prevalent in multiple
   newly industrialized nations, including Pakistan, South Africa, and
   China. While the rise of the Indian fast food industry is a sign of
   economic growth, it comes with the cost of rising obesity due to the
   lack of adequate health emphasis and education in India.
--
   profile and growing middle class income, a more experimental nature and
   interest in the “foreign” is prevalent in cities. As a result, interest
   in American fast food is peaking. In the past year, Burger King
   partnered with Everstone, a major Indian real-estate company, to expand
   the number of outlets throughout the country.<lt;sup>gt;4<lt;/sup>gt;

   The foreign fast food influence in India is a direct contributor of
   increasing health issues as a result of the country’s historically weak
   emphasis on health maintenance. Until recently, public health education

   which dominate with an 84% share of total FSR value sales in 2003.
   Independent operators hold more than an almost 90% value share of the
   Fast food sector in India, offering a variety of menus catering to
   local tastes. Therefore, value shares held by Fast food sub sectors
   such as burger and chicken are comparatively low, and penetration is
   still limited.

   acceptance and blending in to the Indian culture still remains a
   challenge for many fast food restaurants. Most multinational-chained

   The researcher wishes to study, how consumers in Chandigarh perceive
   and utilize Western fast food offerings. Chandigarh is a Union
   Territory and the capital city of two states in North India (Punjab and
   Haryana).

   1.3 Project Scope And Research Objectives:
   The scope of the research project is focused on understanding consumer
   behavior of the residents of Chandigarh in respect of Western fast food
   offerings. The key research objective is-
     * To understand preferences of consumers in respect of Western Fast
--

   The research will focus on how consumers in Chandigarh perceive and
   utilize Western fast food offerings in general as well as certain
   categories of it, not to identify how to successfully promote one
   specific brand.
--
   The study gains importance from both the producer and consumer’s point
   of view, as it will identify drawbacks, limitations and constraints
   existing in the Fast food marketing structure.

   1.4 Key Research Questions Addressed in the Study:
     * Who are the consumers of these Western fast food offerings?
     * How do consumers in Chandigarh typically become acquainted with
       Western fast food offerings?
     * What are consumers looking for in Western fast food offerings?
     * What could be done to encourage purchasing of Western fast food
       offerings?

   1.5 Limitations of the Study:
     * The research project concerns a pilot project on a limited number
       of individual western fast food offerings only, which may be
       extended to an envisioned continuous annual research program. After
       preliminary discussions with the major Western fast food sellers in
       Chandigarh three product categories have been selected i.e.
       burgers, pizzas, and
--
   determinants of food consumption behavior of Indians in general and in
   Chandigarh in particular, followed by an overview of the food market
   for Western fast food products.

   2.2 Food consumption behavior
   The key objective of this research project is to learn more about local
   consumer preferences in Chandigarh in respect of Western fast food
   products, especially the way they perceive and utilize these products.
   In order to understand consumer preferences one needs to understand the

   In the mid 1990’s, a spate of global fast food chains entered India to
   capture a part of Indian fast food segment. But they found it difficult
   to establish themselves. Gaining acceptance locally and blending into
   the Indian culture proved difficult. With regards to their menu,
   positioning and advertising, MNC fast food chains had to face lot of
   problems in getting accepted by the Indian consumer. After initial
   problems they realized that it was important to combine the local
--
   foods are considered fresh, healthy, and inexpensive. Given the
   distinct dietary habits and food preference of Indian consumers, it is
   not surprising that until the early 1990s Western fast food chains had
   largely ignored Indian markets. As a result, Nirula’s, the only notable
   Indian fast food chain, has been able to dominate the Indian market in
   fast food service sales^7.

   In an interview, Vikram Bakshi, MD, McDonald’s Delhi, said that even
   though the Indian outfit stuck to its core taste that grew on consumers
   from ‘bland’ to ‘unique’ in three years, with no change factored in by
   the fast food chain, McDonald’s menu still was about 75% different from
   its global menu^8.

   2.4 Fast Food in India:
   The concept of fast food isn’t new. Early in the 19th century, at the
   start of the Industrial Age when people had to work 12 to 14 hours a
   day, there was scarcely any time for long breaks for eating. The first
--
   outside the home have become an essential part of our lifestyle.

   2.4.1 Introduction to Fast food:
   The term “fast food” means just that. However, the boundary between
   fast foods and traditional dishes is fluid. In particular, it’s
   difficult to provide a qualitative distinction. Fast foods can also
--
   of time selecting and eating, and if necessary will eat standing or
   walking, on the bus, park bench, or at work. The variety of foods and
   beverages is usually very limited. Fast food frequently does not come
   with knives and forks, making it “finger food.” When silverware, cups
   and plates are necessary, they are disposable.

   The characteristics of fast food, therefore, are that they require
   little time, offer a limited selection, are finger food, and the
   silverware and plates are disposable. These characteristics readily
--
   etc., and are supplemented with other foods.

   There are three general categories of fast food businesses:
   1. Self-service restaurants with a fast-food palette like McDonalds,
   Wendy’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, etc.
--
   or a pair of stand-up tables.

   2.4.2 Fast food Industry Overview:
   Fast food is a food prepared and served quickly at a fast food
   restaurant or a shop. It is served usually in a carton or bags in order
   to minimize cost. Fast food outlets often provide take away or take out
   foods in addition to sit down services. Fast food is a multi billion
   industry continuing to grow at a rapid pace in coming years.

   Fast food is often highly processed and prepared in an industrial
   fashion i.e., with standard ingredients, methodical cooking and
   production methods. Logistical planning and outsourcing of ingredients

   [INS: :INS]
   2.4.3 The Start of Fast food Culture:
   The concept of fast food pops up during 1920s.The 1950s first witnessed
   their rapid proliferation. Several factors that contributed to this
   explosive growth in 50’s were:
--
   Organized food retailing industry is still at infancy stage with share
   less than 1% of food retail market size in India (See Appendix-IV, pg-
   115; Comparison of Organized and Unorganized fast food Outlets). The
   percentage share held by food service of total consumer expenditure on
   food has increased from a very low base to stand at 2.6% in 2001.
--
   attractiveness among 30 emerging markets. The lack of consolidation and
   model retail concepts in India presents better opportunity to global
   players. Over 400 shopping malls, multiplexes, fast food giants,
   restaurants etc. are in planning or construction stage across the
   country^12.

   2.5.1 Market Size &amp; Major Players:
   Fast food is one of the worlds largest growing food type. India’s fast
   food industry is growing by 40% a year and is expected to generate a
   billion dollars in sales by 2005. The multinational segment of Indian
   fast food industry is up to Rs.6 bn, a figure expected to zoom to Rs.70
   bn by 2006. By 2006, the value of Indian dairy products is expected to
   be Rs.1, 00,000 million. In last 6 years, foreign investment in this
   sector stood at Rs. 3600 million, which is about one-fourth of total
   investment made in this sector. Because of the availability of raw
   material for fast food, Global chains are flooding into the country^13.

   There are approximately 22,000 registered restaurants in India. In
   addition, there are more than 100,000 dhabas (small roadside food
   stalls) that sell a variety of foods in cities and on highways. By
   1998, there were approximately 1,568 registered hotels in India, half
--
   India’s imports of processed consumer foods have traditionally remained
   low. Since the early 1990s, India’s food service sales have
   significantly increased. India’s processed and fast food markets have
   shown considerable potential for growth^15

--
   only. However, it claims to cater 50,000 guests everyday.

   Major players in fast food are:
     * McDonalds
     * Nirula’s
--
     * Subway

   Multinational fast food companies have given domestic competition a run
   for its money. While McDonalds sells more than Nirula’s, Pizza Hut and
   Dominos are doing more business than Pizza Corner. Within nine years of
--
   incomes.

   After a slow start, Western-style fast food restaurants have grown
   impressively at 12-15 percent annually over recent years. Most foreign
   chains (McDonald’s, Dominos, Pizza Hut, Subway, KFC, and TGIF) and
   local chains (Nirula’s and Pizza Corner) are doing well in major
   cities, and are expanding into smaller cities. Most of these fast food
   chains have developed a range of Indian-styled products to suit local
   preferences (such as the Maharaja chicken burger, veggie burger, etc.).

   2.7. Factors Affecting the Fast Food Industry in India:
   Income distribution: The long-term growth trend in India is improving.
   The past three decades have seen a steady acceleration. Average annual
--
   variety in their choice of foods and are willing to spend more on
   international cuisine, including fast foods. Consequently, a growing
   number of domestic fast food outlets, home delivery, take-away
   restaurants, and American restaurant chains, such as Kentucky Fried
   Chicken (KFC), TGI Friday’s, Domino’s Pizza, Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, and
--
   largest country in terms of population possesses large potential market
   for all the products/services. This results into entry of large number
   of fast food players in the country.

   Relaxation in rules and regulations: With the economic liberalization
--
   sandwiches and other type of fast foods.

   2.8 Problems of Fast Food Industry in India:
   Environmental friendly products cost high: Government is legislating
   laws in order to keep check on the fast food industry and it is
   emphasizing more on the usage of biodegradable and environment friendly
   products. But associated with this issue is the problem that fast food
   player faces, which is the cost, associated with the environment
   friendly product. They cost much higher then the normal products that
--
   increase their profits. There is an excessive consumption of pizzas,
   noodles, ice-creams, beef/ham/cheese burgers, which constitute the
   universally available fast food. These constitute junk food having
   empty calories, which means this kind of food contains the calories
   that are not particularly helpful to one’s body. These days there is an
--
   There’s often not enough time or opportunity to shop carefully for
   groceries, or to cook and eat with one’s family. Especially on
   weekdays, fast food outside the home is the only solution. Today, only
   40% of young college-age people eat lunch at home. Mostly teenagers and
   young adults use fast food facilities when there is shortage of time.
   According to studies, 66% of young men and 33% of women in Switzerland
   eat one to two hamburgers a week, and half the teenagers eat
--
   gifts for small children, and an ambiance that is generally child- and
   teenager friendly. Large distributors, bakers and butchers, snack bars,
   and so on, also exploit the fast food trend and offer more take-out
   products.

--
   describe this phenomenon.

   Some noticeable facts about fast food industry are: Fast food had
   experienced fast growth in past decade. Changing lifestyles, breakdown
   of joint family system, increasing number of working women’s and
   western influence in urban areas are fuelling the demand for fast food.

   India already has the entire requirement for a head start in Fast food
   industry. Basic materials such as food, vegetables and meat can be
   sourced locally or easily imported if local availability is not

       the process of primary data collection through the questionnaire
       method. The standard questionnaire covered the awareness, attitude
       and behavior towards western fast food products in general and
       three selected product categories in particular.

--
   discussion and conclusion of the research. The sample comprises of 115
   consumers, selected at random. In this stage consumers were interviewed
   near fast food restaurants and information was gathered about their
   awareness, attitudes and preferences towards western fast food
   offerings.

   To make sure that the sample represented the entire Western fast food
   consuming population in the city of Chandigarh, the sample has been
   selected on ‘sector’ wise basis. The city is divided according to
   ‘sectors’ and fast food outlets were selected such that the sample
   represented the entire population of Chandigarh. A full list of the
   fast food outlets has been given in the Appendix to this research.
   The interpretation and analysis, which comprises of both quantitative
   and qualitative nature, is based on both the secondary and primary
--
   3.5 Trends in the Indian Market:

   Marketing to children’s: Fast food outlets in India target children’s
   as their major customers. They introduce varieties of things that will
   attract the children’s attention and by targeting children’s they
--

   Value added technology services: There is continuous improvement in the
   technology as far as fast food market in India is considered. The
   reason behind that is food is a perishable item and in order to ensure
   that it remains fresh for a longer period of time, there is a need for
--
   improvement and up gradation of technology in food sector.

   Attracting different segments of the market: Fast food outlets are
   introducing varieties of products in order to cater the demands of each
   and every segment of the market. They are introducing all categories of

   come and become a customer of their food line.

   3.6 Challenges for the Fast Food Industry in India:
   Social and cultural implications of Indians switching to western
   breakfast food: Generally, Hindus avoid all foods that are believed to
--
   impure foods when they are prepared together. Some foods, such as beef
   or alcohol, are innately polluted and can never be made pure. But now,
   Indians are switching to fast food that contain all those things that
   are considered impure or against there beliefs. Some traditional and
   fundamentalist are against this transformation of food habit and number
--
   deliberate attempt at building an identity of a certain kind for the
   service. For example, McDonald’s in India has a slightly up market
   image than in the US, where it is viewed as cheap American fast food.
   Since a hamburger is an everyday item of American food, it made sense
   for McDonald’s to develop the positioning. In India that slot is
--
   idli-dosa corner food joints in the south, the parantha serving stalls
   in the north, or the tea and samosa corners of Kolkata. Therefore the
   mind space that most of the organized fast food restaurants had tried
   to occupy is of two types- One, the affluent westernized teenager and,
   Second, the modern, upscale family which is possibly driven by children
--

   Emphasis on the usage of biodegradable products: Glasses, silverware,
   plates and cloth napkins are never provided with fast food. Instead,
   paper plates and napkins, polyurethane containers, plastic cups and
   tableware, drinking cartons or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles
--
   Based on the results of the secondary data collection 115 interviews
   were carried out to quantify the awareness, attitudes and behavior
   towards western fast food products in the city of Chandigarh on the
   basis of a questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on
   western fast food in general and three selected product categories in
   particular.
   Advertisements
--
   competitively priced compared to local products.

   Most of the participants preferred to shop at organized fast food
   restaurants rather than in street stalls for the following reasons:
     * Shop premises is spacious and clean
--
     * Fresh ingredients used

   But, they also find the Western fast food offerings more expensive as
   compared to local fast food offerings. Older consumers prefer local
   fast food restaurants as compared to Western fast food restaurants. The
   most important reason being that Western fast food restaurants are
   often crowded with youngsters, and they prefer visiting restaurants
   where there is no self-service.
--
   participants are likely to purchase because these food products are
   perceived as clean and hygienic. Beverages are most often mentioned in
   combination with Western fast food items. Most of the participants are
   likely to purchase products that can be consumed as snack every day,
   which is having fewer fats. Frozen pizzas are not bought because people
   rather preferred fresh pizzas at Western restaurants such as Pizza Hut.

   Consumers like fast food offerings with a light sauce such as tomato
   sauce or with a special sauce (chutney) made from fresh vegetables for
   a healthier variant. Consumers are least likely to purchase alcoholic
   (beer, etc.) items because they don’t find it suitable with Western
   fast foods. Frozen offerings (frozen pizzas) also seem as least likely
   buy. All the participants prefer beverages with the Western fast food
   offerings. Participants did not like too oily products and salads are
   also mentioned by most of the buyers as a good combination with the
--
   average, they consume Western fast foods 3 to 4 times a week at
   restaurants, mostly at breakfast or at lunchtime, but some of them
   consume Western fast food up to 8 times a week. Participants opt for
   western cuisine at fast food restaurants such as McDonalds, Kentucky
   Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and local organized fast food restaurants as
   these are the places that they recognized from their childhood onwards
   and are perceived to provide clean, quick, and reasonably priced food.
--
   Therefore, they would purchase the best quality food provided that the
   food is fresh, not expensive, has traditional flavors that satisfies
   their simple eating habits. Those who liked Western fast food as meal
   perceived it as cleaner and more hygienic, time saving, better quality
   and less expensive because of in-store promotions, and above all other
   family members, especially children liked the offerings.

   4.6.2 General attitudes towards Western fast food products:
   Most of the participants preferred Western fast food products above
   local fast food products for the following reasons (see also previous
   paragraph):
     * Food is fresher
--
   along with most often occurring motives as understood from the
   secondary data. Participants ranked their most important motives to try
   a Western fast food product for the first time in order of importance
   as follows:

--
   buying practices are family members, closed related friends, health
   issues, product information, in-store promotions and advertising.
   Most of the consumers agreed that Western fast food products are
   hygienic/safe to eat, easily available, time saving, convenient/easy to
   eat, ideal for social gatherings, enjoyable, give value for money and
--
   standard, eating habit, better nutritional value and freshness.
   Half of the participants agreed that a brand was important when
   choosing Western fast food products because of the following factors:
     * The general image of the company; if the company has a good
       reputation, this was perceived as a guarantee for high quality
--
   food products include taste, store cleanliness, freshness, nutritional
   benefits, food quality, price, country of origin, packaging and brand
   name. All participants are aware that the price of Western fast food
   products is higher than the prices for local food products. However,
   they are willing to pay more for a Western food product over a similar
--
   preference for freshness. As most of the participants spend most of
   their time outside their home, food shopping tends to be done daily.
   Because generally fast food products are consumed right away there is
   no need for storage or preservation, therefore, products are always
   purchased extremely fresh. When eating alone or in small groups, there
--
   encourage or discourage the adoption of Western fast foods.

   Seniors are generally less likely to adopt Western fast food
   consumption behaviors (home cooked food is generally preferred by
   elderly people). The role of mass media in the adoption of Western fast
--
   product to be chosen over a similar Indian product.

   However, the people’s love for fast food is reflected in the
   overwhelming number of fast food outlets, whether they are western fast
   food restaurants, local fast food restaurants, snack shops or street
   stalls/kiosks.

--
   The food market in Chandigarh is a large market, which offers
   opportunities for overseas suppliers and producers as a significant
   number of fast food products are in big demand. Chandigarh has a
   population of 6.5 million, comprising mostly of domestic households.

--
   love to associate themselves with the western culture. Gender roles are
   now changing. Females have started working outside. So, they have no
   time for their home, especially for cooking food. Fast food is an easy
   way out because these are easily available and are convenient/easy to
   eat. Larger families often dine out at dinnertime, and most working
   people dine out at lunchtime.

   Awareness of Western fast food products among Hong Kong consumers is
   high. On average shoppers mention 3.8 Western fast food products
   (un-prompted), when asked. Fresh pizzas, burgers, hot-dogs, French
   fries and sandwiches are mentioned most.

   Local fast food restaurants are the main outlets for fresh food
   products, especially among elderly grocery shoppers. However, as
   younger generations tend to adopt a more Western lifestyle, Western
   fast food outlets are enjoying an increasing share of the market.

   The market for western fast food products is a highly competitive
   market in Chandigarh, due to its free and open nature. Fast food chains
   are originating from all over the world, but the dominant fast food
   chains are from the U.S. Due to the ambience and better service
   conditions, local fast food outlets are preferred by the elderly
   consumers.

   5.1.2 Who are the Consumers of Western fast food products:
   Western food products are mostly bought by consumers in the younger age
   group or are bought on behalf of them by family members/older relatives
--
   relatively open to try out new products and tastes. Differences in age
   and income are important determinants of attitudes and preferences
   towards Western fast food products.

   Hamburgers:
--
   for their children.

   5.1.3 How consumers become acquainted with Western fast food products:
   The influence of western culture through media or recommendation from
   relatives or close friends is an important factor of how people get
   acquainted with Western fast food products. Another important way for
   consumers to learn about Western fast foods is dining out in one of the
   many Western restaurants. Especially fast food chains as McDonalds and
   Pizza Hut are well known by consumers. Other important direct triggers
   are advertising, in-store promotions in fast food outlets such as Happy
   meals, free gifts for kids and so on.

--
   – Advertising, in-store promotions (20%)

   5.1.4 What are consumers looking for in Western fast food products:
     * Generally, Western fast food products are preferred above local
       fast food products for the following reasons:
       – Freshness – Better/durable packaging
       – Better quality – Easy and quick to consume
       – Clean and hygienic – Variety in offerings
       – Better sales service – Better nutritional value
     * Consumers think that the price of Western fast food products is
       higher than the price of local foods, but they are willing to pay
       more for quality and service. Average and higher income shoppers
--
     * Taste appears to be strength and a weakness for different products.
       49% of all respondents, regardless of gender, age or income; rate
       taste as the most important factor why they like Western fast food
       products. However, when inquiring the dislikes towards Western food
       products, price and ‘unhealthy to eat’ are rated by most of the
       participants as the main ‘dislike’. Younger people like Western
       fast food products more because of its taste, convenience (easy to
       eat) and quality. Higher income shoppers like Western fast food
       products more because of its taste, quality, its appearance and
       packaging. However, most of the female consumers dislike the
       offerings because of its higher price.
     * Purchasing a branded product is considered important when choosing
       Western fast food products. Consumers associate these with the
       general image of the company as a guarantee for the quality, safety
       and hygiene of the product sold by that company. Well-known brands
--
       difference to the consumers.
       Hamburgers:
     * Western hamburgers are mainly bought in Western fast food outlets.
       Convenient/easy to eat, ‘children like it’ and taste are the most
       important reasons for buying hamburgers. Female and older buyers
--
       important products preferred in combination with the hamburgers are
       beverages, ketchup, and salads. When hamburgers are not available,
       some buyers would buy any kind of fast food product, whether
       western or local, as an alternative, while others would end up not
       buying anything at all.
--
     * 53% of the consumers buy pizzas 1-2 times per week and purchase
       frequency of pizzas is higher in the income group of Rs.15, 000-25,
       000. Pizzas are mainly bought in Western fast food outlets. Taste
       is the most important reason for buying pizzas. Taste and having
       too much caloric value are also the most important reasons people
--
     * Most buyers would not buy another substitute in case of
       unavailability of a pizza, although 79% of the younger buyers
       (15yrs. to 25yrs.) would prefer any kind of Western fast food as an
       alternative to pizzas. The most important products preferred in
       combination with the pizzas are beverages, ketchup, dip sauce and
--

   5.2 Introduction to Recommendations:
   The Fast food industry in India is poised for significant growth over
   the next few decades, particularly in urban India. Gaining local
   acceptance and blending in to the Indian culture still remains a
   challenge for many fast food restaurants. The study was undertaken with
   an objective to understand the preferences of consumers in Chandigarh
   on Western fast food offerings and based on the results of the study
   the main objective was to identify factors to be considered to
   encourage buying of western fast food offerings.
   Following are some of the recommendations that can be adopted by
   various brands to encourage the buying of Western fast food products.

   India’s fast food industry is growing by 40% a year and is expected to
   generate a billion dollars in sales by 2006. Marketing of fast food and
   getting a foothold in India is going to be highly competitive in the
   near future because of the high potential of the Indian processed food
   sector. On an average, each household spends about 50% of income on
   food and beverages. Following factors should be considered to encourage
   purchasing of Western fast food products:
     * Price appears to be a critical factor in the choice making process
       of consumers, especially younger people. A typical Indian is price
       sensitive because of his modest disposable income and he has
       comparable options in local food. Globally fast food chains only
       succeed when they bring their prices down to the same level as the
       street food. The trick can be to make the offerings better than the
       local food, and price them competitively. Most of the times this
       becomes impossible, so this can be counterbalanced by concentrating
--
       attractive feature. The trend towards takeaways is also fast
       gaining popularity among Indian consumers. Most of the consumers of
       fast food products are from the younger age group; therefore the
       potential consumers should be enticed with TV spots, children
       parties, gifts for kids, and an ambience that is child and teenager
       friendly. Older consumers prefer to visit local fast food
       restaurants instead of self-service Western style restaurants;
       hence addressing such need can be an added feature. In India,
       social and cultural values have a very strong hold on the people.
       The fast food culture has imposed greatly on the views of
       youngsters and the desire for a large family meal. The marketers
       should focus more on positioning themselves as family restaurants
--
       into the diets of consumers. The marketers should gauge to what
       extent preferences converge between the west and India with respect
       to product category. Fast food outlets should introduce varieties
       of products in order to cater the demands of each and every segment
       of the market. Fusion of Indian flavors with western products can
--
       having a more efficient distribution system in par with existing
       global standards. It needs to expand in India in parallel to the
       new trend in fast food chains, setting out tiny outlets such as
       express, takeaway, delivery and small dine-ins by fuel stations, in
       multiplexes and other highly frequently visited locations.
--
   existing research gaps:
     * The research project concerned a pilot project on a limited number
       of individual Western fast food offerings only, which may be
       extended to an envisioned continuous annual research programme. The
       scope and content of the study could be widened if similar research
--
       of consumers for the various offerings, and services (e.g.
       home-delivery service, etc.). It will give a deep insight about
       liking and buying behavior of consumers towards Western fast food
       offerings.
     * More intensive and time bound location specific research efforts
       are needed to get a foothold in a highly competitive fast food
       market like India.

Nirula’s: The place that introduced Delhi to its fast food culture

   Anushka Goel

   A post shared by Kanpurwants (@kanpurwants)

   The brand, India’s oldest fast food chain, originated as Hotel India by
   Nirula Brothers, Lakshmi Chand Nirula and Madan Gopal Nirula. They soon
   started to open coffee shops and restaurants, before entering the fast
   food business in the 1970s. In 1977, the first fast food restaurant in
   Delhi was opened by the name of Nirula’s, to which, additions such as a
   pastry shop, hot shoppe and an ice cream parlour were later added.
--

   The restaurant chain soon opened new outlets, becoming what was
   probably India’s first – and oldest – fast food restaurant chain. It
   attracted customers from nearby towns, and became a part of several
   experiences and ‘firsts’. Be it movies at Chanakya, first dates,

Growing menace of fast food consumption in India: time to act

   immensely. India with rich heritage of foods and recipes had the
   tradition of preparing foods by deep frying in fats. This situation is
   getting complicated by emerging fast food culture in all sections of
   society primarily due to their readily availability, easy to access,
   taste, marketing strategies and cafeteria culture. Therefore it becomes
   imperative to introspect about fast food consumption. There are enough
   scientific evidences in India to substantiate that fast food have
   become integral component of diet in all section of society. High
   consumption of fast food has been reported in school going children and
   this is quite substantial in college and university students - in spite
   of the fact that a significant proportion of population are aware about
   adverse consequences of fast food consumption. Children of pregnant and
   lactating women eating fast foods are more prone to obesity. High fat
   and high sugar diet leads to change in fetal brain reward pathway
   altering food preferences. Fast food consumption is rising in India
   across all income categories and this is contributing significantly to
   rising trend of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in this country.
   Regulation of marketing and nutritional labeling is not up to mark in
   India. Growing menace of fast food consumption needs to be restricted
   by adopting legal, service and education approaches for promoting
   healthy dietary practices.

Short History of Street Food. Love for Indian Street Food at Indico

   5 May 2017

   Street food consists of readymade food items that are sold by a vendor
   in markets or open places. They may include the solid food items,
   various drinks or juices. Street food has become a very important
   business nowadays. And people have always admired and loved street food

Difference between street food and fast food

   A strong association between street food and fast food is often
   created. But this is entirely wrong. They can only be linked in the
   sense that both are readily available. You don’t have to wait extra
   time for it to get prepared. But there is a huge difference in their
   preparation methods and qualities.
   • Fast food is a processed food. Its preparation includes using lots of
   preservatives and chemical compounds. Fast food companies spend lots of
   money for preserving the texture and flavor of their food items with
   the use of these chemical additives. Whereas the street food is fresh
   and pure, just like homemade food, free from all sorts of
   preservatives.
   • Chefs and vendors prepare the street food in front of the customers.
   So the customer knows the ingredients of the food items. On the other
   hand in fast food, a person is totally oblivion of right ingredients
   • Street food consists of traditional dishes of that area. This is not
   the case with fast food.

Why is Street Food Loved Around the World?

   [g3LuLyDGtK.jpg]

   Ask any food lover who loves to eat at a roadside food stall as to why
   they're so fond of street food? We bet, you won't just get a single
   reason, because there are so many reasons behind the cravings for
   street food throughout the world. To name some:
     * Street foods are the cheapest. For people who don't have a
       sufficient income, people who are bored of eating a home-cooked
       meal, unemployed people, Indian street food comes as a blessing for
       everyone. No matter who you are or what your financial status is,
       street food is something that fits everyone's pockets.
     * Many times when you walk on the road, the smell of some roadside
       dish hits you, and you decide to stop and have a plate of your

       have it, because there's always a particular space reserved for
       such mouth-watering food.
     * Ever observed the people who eat roadside food? If you did, then
       you must be aware of the way they eat - some are slurping, some are
       licking their fingers, some are just busy smelling the food before

The Vast Diversity of Indian Street Food

   [lk4Oztl5Tq.jpg]
--
   difference in culture, diversity in languages spoken, a variety of
   people, and diversity in food as well. Every Indian state, every Indian
   city has its speciality when it comes to street food. Can you roam the
   streets of Indore without having the mouth-watering 'Poha and Jalebi'
   which is the finest street food and speciality of Indore? Can you walk
   through the busy and crowded lanes of Mumbai without grasping a
   'Vadapav'? What about the lip-smacking 'Aloo-tikkis' of Lucknow, Uttar
   Pradesh or the most popular 'Idlis and Vada-Sambhar' of Chennai? You
   won't be able to resist the temptation! When it comes to street food,
   no other country can beat India where not just one or two or three, but
   every single state and city has its variety of delicacies.

What Makes Indian Street Food so Popular

   [TRNhejY0VJ.jpg]

   The popularity of Indian street food can be known from the very fact
   that every day millions of people from different regions prefer to eat
   roadside food from various street vendors. According to our Ancient
   Hindu Dietary rules, there are two concepts when it comes to food -
   Kaccha food and Pakka food. These concepts are still at play even

   food today, it is no more unclean or unhealthy (unless you eat from
   some very rearward area.) You will find that almost every other Indian
   street food vendor uses vegetables, pulses as well as many ayurvedic
   species such as garlic and turmeric. All these healthy ingredients add
   to the richness of street food. Moreover, many street vendors these
   days wear disposable gloves to avoid any health problem.

History of Street Food

   Read time: 2 Min
   France, 04th August 2015

            The roots of street food can take us way back into history. It
   is believed that as the first distribution point of street food, small
   fried fish were sold on the streets in ancient Greece. Street food was
   widely consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement
   homes did not have ovens or hearths. In ancient China, where street
   foods generally catered to the poor, wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street foods and bring meals back for their masters to
   eat in their homes. Urbanisation and street food go hand in hand.
   Historically, in places such as ancient Rome, street food was purchased
   because urban poor did not have kitchens in their homes. Across the
   globe, street food, sometimes also synonymous with fast food, has
   become an important part of daily life as local population increasingly
   struggle to keep pace with their hectic lifestyles. The street vendors
   offer hotfresh, lip smacking snacks which are very filling and absolute
   value for money. Take-out food, junk food, snacks, and fast food are
   synonymous with street food and all of these can be purchased on the
   foot path without entering any building. These foods are popular mainly
   because they are easily available, and that too at half the price or
   less of any restaurant food. It is of particular cultural importance to
   India, where this forms the means of livelihood for many pushcart
   vendors, dhaba owners and their families. This street food culture also
   ensures that the connection with India’s rich cultural heritage is
   retained, with influences ranging from the Mughal dynasty to the
   British Empire. According to an estimate of the Food and Agriculture
   Organisation, which was released in 2012, over 2.5 billion people eat
   street food in India every day. The National Street Food Festival,
   which is an annual event organised in Delhi by the National Association
   of Street Food Vendors of India is a platform where street food from
   all the states of the country is showcased. This is a platform which
   showcases the cultural diversity of the country in the culinary space –
   specially catering to street food.

           Today, while some street foods are regional, many are not,
   having spread beyond their region of origin. A lot of people, who have
   not been exposed to the street food culture, shy away from it thinking
   it is unhealthy and unhygienic. However, one would be surprised to
   note, that despite concerns about contamination at street food vendors,
   the incidence of such is low with multiple studies showing rates
   comparable to restaurants.

Tips for enjoying street food in India

   Don’t be afraid of Indian street food. There’s always a risk of
   encountering an unhygienic street food stall and getting a bad stomach
   but then again, sometimes, this can happen in famous restaurants too.
   This leads me to my next point…

   Go where the locals are. If you see a long queue of locals in front of
   a street food stall, that’s the best indicator that this particular
   vendor serves not only food that’s safe to eat but also delicious.

   Be careful with street food drinks that aren’t hot. If the water didn’t
   boil, you can never be too sure how the water used to prepare that
   drink will impact your stomach. Just because locals are drinking it

Why India’s street food vendors are the essence of the country’s food
Industry

   I was watching a documentary series on street food. The series had
   various episodes titled after cities in Asia, such as Bangkok, New
   Delhi, Seoul, etc. The episode uncovering New Delhi’s street food
   devotees was my favorite choice, considering my Indian roots. It spoke
   about the backgrounds of the different street vendors serving various
--
   the vendors’ lives, businesses, and services to Delhi’s people.
   Ultimately, the documentary thoughtfully represented the enthusiasm and
   success of Indian street food businesses. Essentially, it is important
   to understand that the Indian street food business is an essence of
   flavorsome when it comes to shaping the Indian food market.


   According to cultural Historian Rana Safvi, the concept surrounding
   street food consists of ancient imported roots from the Tomars, the
   Rajputs, the British, and the Mughal empire. Hence, Safvi says that
   when people indulge in infamous street dishes such as the Nihari, or
   the Seekh Kebab, they are also tasting history in the present day.
   Furthermore, Safvi also states that the street food business serves all
   kinds of people – from the working-class category to students – to the
   rich folk – to any common man. Consequently, according to the Program
   Head of the National Association of Street Vendors, Sangeeta Singh,
   “many people don’t seem to have kitchens, and are totally dependent on
   street food for their meals; so if someone has to taste real food,
   authentic food, it has to be street food.”

   Over the years, the street food scene in India has grown with
   popularity. According to a food website, the street food industry has
   grown with prominence because of its high demand in the food market.
   Another food website states that its market share is also expanding
--


   However, some people in India also avoid street food stalls in concern
   of hygiene standards followed by vendors. They feel fearful of
   sanitation, quality, and surroundings. However, the report states that
   street food stalls usually serve a preponderance of the population in a
   city. Moreover, street food vendors across India suffer from
   displacement on a daily basis. They can also suffer from legal
   sanctions and have depleted constitutional recognition. Additionally,
--
   standard protocols and requirements in following the Food Safety and
   Standards Act 2006. However, Anne Dahmen also states that the
   perception and overall situation of street food surrounding uncertainty
   can be improved by the government by managing the sector better, i.e.,
   by regulating the process to be more participatory.

   This industry has grown and preserved economies in the country.
   According to a media report, if street food stalls fold permanently,
   then the high cost to be beared by a customer and effort to find food
   which has similar value would be difficult. Furthermore, according to
   Anne Dahmen, if proper training based on legalities, hygiene, and
   preparation is administered by different authorities through various
   schemes to various street vendors across India, then the street food
   industry can be pillars of sustenance for societies. For instance, the

THE BEST INDIAN STREET FOODS

    1. What is Indian Street Food?
    2. Tips for Eating Street Food in India
    3. 30 Must-Try Indian Street Foods
    4. Popular Cities for Street Food in India

WHAT IS INDIAN STREET FOOD?

   In some countries like Japan, street food is limited. Not so in India.
   Indian street food is as diverse and plentiful as Indian cuisine. Every
   region has its own specialties with city vendors offering hundreds if
   not thousands of different options.

   The history of street food in India isn’t well documented, but it’s
   widely believed that its origins can be traced back to the time when
   the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan moved his capital from Agra to Delhi.
   Chaat, the most popular type of Indian street food, was first
   introduced to Old Delhi during that time. It became popular as a
   mid-day snack after cooks from Varanasi were invited to set up shop in
   Delhi by officials of the Mughal Dynasty.

   Today, street food has become an important part of Indian culture and
   has taken root in every part of the country. Its affordability makes it
   accessible to everyone. Aside from chaat, other popular varieties of
   Indian street food include kebabs, biryani, korma, and kulfi.

TIPS FOR EATING STREET FOOD IN INDIA

   Have you heard of “Delhi belly”? It’s the term for traveler’s diarrhea
   in india. It’s very much a real thing and something you should be
   concerned about when eating the street food in India. I was aware of it
   and tried my best not to catch it, but I still suffered a bout of
   diarrhea in Mumbai, probably from street vendor ice cream.

   As tempting as it is to try every Indian street food dish that catches
   your eye, it’s best to exercise caution as you don’t want a
   debilitating case of the runs ruining your trip to India. Here are a
   few pointers to remember when eating street food in India.
    1. Look for popular street food stalls.  The more customers a stall
       has, the better and safer it’s food is likely to be.
    2. Avoid dishes and drinks made with water.  Unfiltered water is the
--
       undistilled water like ice cubes, fresh fruit juices, and sauces.
       The same goes for produce washed in tap water.  If you can, find
       street food stalls that prepare their food using distilled water.
    3. Fried or grilled dishes are safer.  Heat kills bacteria so fried or
       grilled dishes are typically safer to eat.  The same goes for
--
    4. Avoid meat dishes.  Stay away from meat dishes if you can because
       you don’t know how long they’ve been sitting out.
    5. Go on a street food tour.  As a foreigner, it’s difficult to know
       for sure which street food stalls are safe.  For peace of mind, I
       highly recommend going on a street food tour in India.  A
       knowledgeable guide will take you to the city’s best and safest
       street food stalls so all you have to worry about is how much you
       can eat. Check out Get Your Guide for a list of food tours in
       Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and other cities in India.

   I went on a food tour in Mumbai and the first place we went to was a
   stall selling nimbu masala soda. According to my guide, it was a great
   way of prepping our stomachs for the many street food dishes we were
   about to have.

--
   I had it in Delhi as well on a food tour, but towards the end of our
   tour, perhaps to aid in digestion.

   a sign of hospitality. It’s a warming drink that can be enjoyed as is

   Can you guess what type of lassi this is? It’s a mug of sweet lassi

   good and highly addictive nonetheless.

4. Masala Chana Dal Chaat

   chaat.

   Like the chana dal chaat, it’s a fun Indian street food snack that goes
   very well with beer. In fact, both of these stalls were located side by

   Poha refers to flattened or beaten rice. It can be used to refer to
   both the ingredient and the Indian dishes made with it. It’s a popular
   Indian breakfast staple that’s also commonly sold as street food.

   There are many Indian dishes made with poha but one of the most

   fennel seeds.

   sauce. Vadas are soft lentil fritters while dahi refers to yogurt, so
   the name dahi vadas literally means “fritters soaked in yogurt”. It’s a
   popular Indian festival dish that’s also commonly sold as street food.

   To prepare, urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter
--
   an interesting texture that’s similar to soft fluffy donuts.

   Like many of the dishes in this Indian street food guide, dahi vada is
   popular throughout the country where it goes by different names like
   dahi bhalla, dahi bade, thayir vadai, doi bora, and thairu vada.

   served to me. You can choose from four stuffed kulfi flavors – mango,
   apple, orange, and pomegranate. I wish I could have tried all four.

POPULAR CITIES FOR STREET FOOD IN INDIA

   Street food is popular all throughout India but some cities are better
   known for it than others. Listed below are five of the most popular
   cities for street food in India.

1. Delhi

   It’s no surprise that Delhi tops this list considering that it may
   indeed be the city that first popularized street food in India. Just
   spend a day exploring the labyrinthine alleyways of Chandni Chowk and
   you’ll be mesmerized by its dizzying array of street food!

   I went on a street food tour in Old Delhi and got to experience some of
   the city’s tastiest examples of jalebi, pani puri, paratha, kachori,
   kulfi, and more. Delhi has a reputation for having some of the best
   food in India and its street food is no exception.

2. Kolkata

   Like Delhi, Kolkata is often cited for being one of the best cities for
   street food in India. It’s the birthplace of the kathi roll and home to
   many delicious street food dishes like jhalmuri, puchkas, Mughlai
   parathas, and the Kolkata fish fry.

   I went on a food tour in Kolkata and got to experience a plethora of
   street food dishes along with other tasty examples of Bengali cuisine.
   My guide even took me to a few heritage stalls that have been open for
   well over a hundred years!
--
   Indore is often called the food capital of central India, and with good
   reason. It’s famous for its Indori poha with jalebi and other tasty
   street food dishes like dahi vadas, bhutte ka kees, khatta samosas, and
   kulfi falooda.

FINAL THOUGHTS ON INDIAN STREET FOOD

   30 street food dishes may seem like a lot in many countries but not in
   India. In this vast country where street food is life, this list of 30
   is just the very tip of the iceberg. But I do hope it gives you enough
   to go on and gets you even more excited to experience the street food
   in India.

Street Food: the story

Street Food has existed ever since the first urban settlements were created.

   The most ancient evidence of food prepared and cooked on the street

   nourishing dishes affordable by all.

   And thus street food has evolved over the centuries in parallel with
   our civilisation, but discreetly, leaving very few traces considering
   its close links with the common people. But during the Middle Ages the
--
“TERRITORY AND TRADITION” IT’S TALKED ABOUT, IT’S BOASTED ABOUT.

   This is perhaps the greatest misapprehension about street food: because
   it was born poor, from the  primary need to feed the populace cheaply,
   it has always been considered of little worth. However, particularly in
   these times of globalisation, street food is often the last bastion of
   a place’s traditions and identity. Consider the panino con la milza
   (bread with spleen) of Sicilian markets, or with lampredotto (tripe)
--
   emblem of popular Italian cuisine, occupies the same role as the
   English pie, arising from the need to feed the poor in the streets. In
   this context, street food identifies and distinguishes territory and
   tradition, keeping alive one of the most important aspects of local
   culture, the eating habits of the people.

   aspect - sometimes a rediscovery - and investing in the quality of

“STREET FOOD IS THE TRUE TESTIMONY TO THE IDENTITY OF A PEOPLE”

   IThe manifesto of today’s Street Food could be “Street food is the true
   testimony to the identity of a people”. It undoubtedly gauges the depth
   of traditional food culture, but also measures its ability to
   continually reinvent itself in the constantly evolving everyday urban
   jungle, while retaining is roots firmly in the history of a region. In
   a nutshell, street food has freed itself from prejudice and reclaimed
   its rightful place in the sun as an expression of culinary
   civilisation.

   and raw forms and hence cannot taste like their modified versions. So
   don’t be disappointed if you don’t find the buttered versions. Enjoy

   competing with others.

   By eating at a street food cart or stall, you not just satisfy your
   hunger and save money, but also help many families earn a living and
   make ends meet.

   Street food is a two-way relationship where you benefit by getting
   cheap and good food on your plate and in return, help put food on the

   taste, smell and feeling of something particular or everything cooked
   on the street have been said to boost the morale of many who throng the
   streets daily, livening them up and even warding off depression.

   Street food can fill you up with positive feelings and the assurance of

   fact, fast food is the real junk food in every sense. You see, fast
   food has been proved to be more harmful than anything that gets cooked
   and sold on the streets.

   but fast food or junk food is food that has many processed food
   ingredients that cause long term health issues, it eaten daily.

   and can be afforded by just about everyone. You don’t need to be filthy
   rich to eat street food. As a matter of fact even those who are still
   searching for jobs, enjoy street food without any constraints.

   But don’t let the cheap prices of street food fool you. The low prices
   don’t mean that the quality of food is always questionable. Yes, every
   now and then, there comes news about some street food vendor messing up
   the trust of his patrons owing to sheer neglect and unconcern. But
   trust us such incidents are not rare even in a grade restaurants. It’s

   capacity to eat.

   but also discuss about how other major issues of the world can be

   both business and home. So they eat the same food that they sell at
   their food carts. That assures that the food is of good quality in
   every sense as they eat it themselves.

   There can be exceptions at times where some irresponsible street food
   vendors cut corners to earn extra profits. However, they are easy to
   detect and should be avoided at all costs.

   Street food culture has been around for millenia. It’s been sustaining
   the masses in major cities since urbanisation drove many people to find
   work in city centres. To this day, it still serves that purpose with
   densely populated cities like Bangkok, Tokyo and Singapore being the
   street food capitals of the world. Versions of this street food exist
   all over the globe and they’re constantly changing and adapting to suit
   the needs of the people they serve. We explore the multicultural and
   diverse history of street food and how this trend takes shape in South
   Africa today.

What is Street Food?

   Street food is, well, food served on the street. It’s typically served
   from food trucks, carts, hatches or even tables in major city centres
   where foot traffic is high and constant. It serves people who are

   cities, where residential living space is dwindling, working class
   families often live in very small apartments that don’t have space for
   a kitchen. Street food is sometimes cheaper and more accessible
   compared to buying groceries, and has become common practice for people
   to rely on vendors for daily sustenance.

     Street food is the people’s food, originating from a need to feed
     the working class who couldn’t afford expensive cuisine or
     ingredients.

   In Singapore, street food is mostly served in ‘hawker centres’ which
   are large complexes, occupied by tables and dozens of street food
   vendor hatches. Hawker centres are known to have some of Singapore’s
   tastiest and cheapest food, and many people and families eat there

     Street food is sometimes cheaper and more accessible compared to
     buying groceries, and has become common practice for people to rely
     on vendors for daily sustenance.

   These days, pretty much any type of meal can be served as street food.
   It’s no longer just meats and salads wrapped in bread, like shawarma,
   or food served on sticks. Some of the most popular street food dishes
   include aloo chaat from Northern India, bahn mi from Northern Vietnam,
   crepes from France, tacos from Mexico and mango sticky rice from
   Bangkok, to name the bare minimum. Street food has become so popular —
   there are several Netflix shows dedicated to documenting the history of
   street food and many more YouTube series highlighting everyday cooks
   who feed the hungry masses. These dishes have become ingrained in
   global food culture that often we aren’t even aware that the dish we

The People’s Food

   Street food is the people’s food, originating from a need to feed the
   working class who couldn’t afford expensive cuisine or ingredients.
   Nowadays, street food serves to preserve indigenous food cultures
   around the world and vendors can often serve as welcome reminders of
   ‘home’ for those living in foreign cities. In countries like South
   Africa, where there are many cultural groups living in diaspora, some
   of the most popular street food vendors are those making dishes that
   draw inspiration from their cultural heritage and upbringing in South
   Africa.

   Ready-to-eat food or drink on a street

   Street food in New York City
   Street food in Yangon Chinatown, Myanmar

   Street food is ready-to-eat food or drinks sold by a hawker, or vendor,
   in a street or at other public places, such as markets or fairs. It is
   often sold from a portable food booth,^[1] food cart, or food truck and
   is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but
   many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are
   classified as both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper
   than restaurant meals. The types of street food widely vary between
   regions and cultures in different countries around the world.^[2]
   According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization,
   2.5 billion people eat street food every day.^[3] A majority of
   middle-income consumers^[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service
   of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in
   developing countries.

Europe[edit]

   In ancient Greece, small fried fish was a street food,^[5] however, the
   Greek philosopher Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low
   regard.^[6] Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was
   discovered during the excavation of Pompeii.^[7] Street food was widely
   consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes
   did not have ovens or hearths.^[8] Chickpea soup^[9] with bread and
   grain paste^[10] were common meals. In ancient China, street food
   generally catered to the poor, though wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their
   homes.^[8]

   meat," including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted.^[11] In
   1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and
   standardize street food.^[12]

   In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold
   gingerbread nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other
   meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside.^[13] French
   fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a
   street food in Paris in the 1840s.^[14] Street foods in Victorian
   London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and
   jellied eels.^[15]
--
   During the American Colonial period, "street vendors sold oysters,
   roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes."
   Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until
   around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise.^[20]
   Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After
   previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food
   vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707.^[21] Many
   women of African descent made their living selling street foods in
--
   fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines and
   other sweets in New Orleans.^[22] Cracker Jack started as one of many
   street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.^[23]

Asia[edit]

   The selling of street food in China stretches back millennia and became
   an integral part of Chinese food culture during the Tang Dynasty.
   Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with
   regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary
   tourism.^[24] Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has
   had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced
   the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street
   food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers
   imported from China during the late 19th century.^[25]

   Ramen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100
   years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However,
   it soon became a "national dish" and even acquired regional
   variations.^[26]

   Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of
   Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the
   early 1960s,^[27] when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the
   street food culture, and by the 1970s it had "displaced
   home-cooking."^[28] As a result, many Thai street foods are derived
   from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine.^[29] About 76% of urban
   residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of
   the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity
   of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone
   generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee,
   Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects
   the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually
   from 2020 forward.^[30] Multiple studies showed that contamination of
   food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the
   contamination at restaurants.^[31] An estimated 2% or 160,000 vendors
   provide street food for Bangkok's 8 million people.^[32]

   In Delhi, India, it is said that ugh kings used to visit the kebab

   Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being "fresh
   and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing]
   heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of
   Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste and fish
   sauce."^[35] Street food in Thailand offers a varied selection of
   ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks. The capital of Thailand,
   Bangkok, has been listed as one of the best places for street

   Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese,
   and Dutch influences.^[38] Indonesian street food is often strongly

   as fritters, nasi goreng and ayam goreng. Bakso (meatball soup), satay

   Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its
   own specialities to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes
   are vada pav, misal pav, chole bhature, parathas, bhel puri, sev puri,
   gol gappa, aloo tikki, kebabs, tandoori chicken, samosas, kachori,

   In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of "plate lunch" (rice,

   Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.^[43]
--
   the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally
   created and run vary in different areas of the world.^[44] Often,
   women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender
   equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street
   vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street
   food trade.^[45] Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes
   towards meals is one "cultural factor operating in the street food
   phenomenon" in the Philippines because eating "food out in the open, in
   the market or street or field" is "not at odds with the meal indoors or
   at home" where "there is no special room for dining".^[13]

   Other cultural phenomena that affect the street food market include the
   cultural implications of eating while walking down the street. In some
   cultures, this is considered to be rude,^[46] such as Japanese^[47] or

   non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.^[49]

   In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce

   As early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food
   vendor activities.^[11] With the increasing pace of globalization and
   tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns
   of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise
   public awareness.^[59]^[60]^[61] However, despite concerns about
   contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low,
   with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.^[43]

   In Singapore, street food vendors known as "hawkers", over half of
   which were unlicensed, were considered "primarily a nuisance to be
   removed from the streets".^[62] 113 hawker centres were constructed

   In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided
   comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and

   ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping
   programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing

   is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in
   tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up
   studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and
   food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been
   devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness.

History of Street Food and Interesting Facts

   Street Food is a type of prepared food sold on the streets and other
   public places. It is usually cheaper food than one sold in restaurants
   and it can be sold from a kiosk, portable food booth, food cart or food
--
   People sold ready-to-eat food since the earliest civilizations. Ancient
   Greeks had street vendors that sold small fried fish while the Ancient
   Romans (or at least their lower classes) depended on street food for
   nutrition because they often didn’t had ovens in their homes to prepare
   food. In China (also ancient) street food was also intended for poor
   but the wealthy citizens would sometimes send their servants to buy
   them street food. Street vendors of 14th century Egypt sold lamb
   kebabs, rice and fritters. Even the Aztecs had vendors in their
   marketplaces that sold atolli (which is a gruel made from maize dough)
   and tamales with different kinds of already prepared meat. In North
   America, during the American Colonial period, street food that was sold
   was tripe, oysters, roasted corn ears, fruit and sweets. Europe of that
   time also knew about street food. Fried strips of potato were sold on
   the streets of Paris in 19th century and were the origin of french
   fries. Transylvanian vendors of the same time sold cookies, cream mixed
   with corn, and bacon. Londoners could by on the street tripe, pea soup,
   pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and jellied eels. Today, street food
   is less local by type and at one place you van find cuisines
   characteristic for a country as well as food from other side of the
   world.

   Indian street food has a very special gastronomic place in India’s food
   history and culture. Indian street food is probably the first thing
   that comes to the mind of food lovers when they think or talk about
   food. Indian street foods are known worldwide for their taste,
   diversity and easy accessibility and available all across the country
   whether it’s a metropolitan city or a small town or a village.
   As there is no conclusive documented history of Indian street food so
   it’s not easy to know exactly when it began but as per the popular
   belief street food in India became popular in Delhi when the Mughal
   Emperor, Shah Jahan moved his capital from Agra to Delhi. Chaats the
   most popular variety of street food available across India today was
   first introduced in Old Delhi to the vegetarian traders as a mid day
   meal by chaat specialist cooks that were invited from Varanasi to Delhi
   to set shop by the officials of the Mughal Dynasty.
   Another variety of street food is Kebabs, Nihari, Biryani, Kormas,
   etc., also seen gaining a lot of acceptance amongst the middle income
   group of the inhabitants of old Delhi who loved their meat and relished

   ‘Main toh raste se jaa raha tha, main toh bhel puri kha raha tha'.
   Almost everyone would be familiar with this very famous 90,s Bollywood
   track. Not only does it aptly depict the actual Indian street food
   scene but is also enough to make you grab a plate of bhel puri right
   away. When it comes to street food, India tops the charts. Food and
   beverages that are usually sold on streets by hawkers and vendors in
   portable stalls and carts is what is termed as street food. Move over
   aloo chaat’s and tikkis as India has got lots to offer. Be it north,
   south, east or west, every region of India has its own specialty. Made
   with a mélange of exotic spices and ingredients, Indian street food is
   one of its kinds. Apart from Indians, a lot of foreign travelers swear
   by Indian street food as well.
   Why is street food loved across the nation so much?
   Ask any food lover who loves to eat at a roadside food stall as to why
   they're so fond of street food? We bet, you won't just get a single
   reason, because there are so many reasons behind the cravings for
   street food throughout the world. To name a few:
   •    Street foods are the cheapest. For people who don't have a
   sufficient income, people who are bored of eating a home-cooked meal,
   unemployed people, Indian street food comes as a blessing for everyone.
   No matter who you are or what your financial status is, street food is
   something that fits everyone's pockets.
   •    Many times when you walk on the road, the smell of some roadside
--
   because there's always a particular space reserved for such
   mouth-watering food.
   •    Ever observed the people who eat roadside food? If you did, then
   you must be aware of the way they eat - some are slurping, some are
   licking their fingers; some are just busy smelling the food before they

   street foods are tasty! You won't find a single food stall across the
   world where people don't enjoy the taste of the food they're offered.
   The vast variety of Indian street food
   India is a country where you will find diversity in everything. The
   difference in culture, diversity in languages spoken, a variety of
   people, and diversity in food as well. Every Indian state, every Indian
   city has its specialty when it comes to street food.
   Can you roam the streets of Indore without having the mouth-watering
   'Poha and Jalebi' which is the finest street food and specialty of
   Indore? Can you walk through the busy and crowded lanes of Mumbai
   without grasping a 'Vada Pav'? What about the lip-smacking 'Aloo

   city has its variety of delicacies.

   also favourite for its famous Dal-Baati Churma and Pakoras. These food
   items can be found in almost every street stall of Bikaner.
   What makes Indian street food so popular?
   The popularity of Indian street food can be known from the very fact
   that every day millions of people from different regions prefer to eat
   roadside food from various street vendors. According to our Ancient
   Hindu Dietary rules, there are two concepts when it comes to food -
   Kaccha food and Pakka food. These concepts are still at play even

   food today, it is no more unclean or unhealthy (unless you eat from
   some very rearward area.) You will find that almost every other Indian
   street food vendor uses vegetables, pulses as well as many ayurvedic
   spices such as garlic and turmeric. All these healthy ingredients add
   to the richness of street food. Moreover, many street vendors these
   days wear disposable gloves to avoid any health problems.

MBA Grad Quits Job To Become Street Food Chef, Turns Americans into Pani Puri
Fans

--

   MBA grad Meherwan Irani’s restaurant Chai Pani in Asheville, USA, is
   becoming the go-to for thousands of hungry Indian street food lovers
   from across borders.

--
   Maharashtra, decided to move to the United States for his MBA degree.
   Before moving continents, however, Meherwan wanted to satisfy his
   craving for Indian street food one last time, as he knew he would
   dearly miss it when he made the transition.

   So he went all out and gorged on the papdi chaat and bhel he could
   possibly find. Street food, you see, was Meherwan’s weakness, and he
   couldn’t bear the thought of leaving it all behind. But, as this
   world-famous chef tells The Better India, life has a funny way of
--

   The idea, he says, was a simple one — to introduce America to the
   Indian street food that he had grown up eating and loving. However, for
   a corporate employee to shift professions wasn’t an easy task. But he
   found support in his wife Molly.
--
   As people from in and around Asheville began frequenting the place, the
   popularity of the dishes grew. Meherwan was amazed at how loved Indian
   street food really was. So, in 2013, having tasted immense success in
   the first branch of the restaurant, he opened another branch in
   Atlanta.
--
   spicy and sweet chutneys.

   And this makes the chef’s day. “I felt Indian street food was one of
   the most underrepresented foods in Western culture. Diners craved the
   stereotype-shattering food, drinks and service of Chai Pani, and this
--
   interesting, unexpected, and personal than a handful of regional
   cuisines that have been popularised so far,” he says. “To me, there is
   no other food that captures the essence of India like street food —
   chaotic, colourful, innovative, vibrant, joyful, complex, and of
   course, delicious.”

   So while, street food lovers gorge on tangy, crunchy, spicy bhel puri
   or satisfy their sweet cravings with a dahi puri or the humble aloo
   tikki chaat, the menu also caters to non-veg aficionados. There’s keema
--
   food, which is meant to be affordable and approachable to everybody.”

   “I’m so proud that Indian food and specifically street food is being
   recognised on a national and global level.”

   Examples of fast food (left to right, top to bottom): Cheeseburger,
   soft drink, french fries, pizza margherita, hot dog, fried chicken,
   submarine sandwich, and donuts.

   Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial
   resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a
   commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with
   frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for
   take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to
   accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
   workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570
   billion globally.^[1]

   The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which
   reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
   primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
   pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef

   cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".

   Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the
   drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no
   shelter or seating,^[2] or fast food restaurants (also known as quick
   service restaurants).^[3] Franchise operations that are part of

   Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and
   calories.^[5] Fast food has been linked to increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol,
   insulin resistance conditions and depression.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding
   lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast food
   consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.^[11]

   and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family
   dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway
   fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is

   minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes

   own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers,

   A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the
   fish and chip shop and fast food industries.^[21] As a cheap fast food
   served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the
   Victorian working classes.^[21] By 1910, there were more than 25,000
   fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more
   than 35,000 shops.^[22] Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain
   opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in
   1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish
   and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.^[23]

   British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the
   regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective
   area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of
   fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl
   commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used
   more frequently in fast food.^[24] The UK has adopted fast food from
   other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More
   recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also
   emerged.

   As automobiles became popular and more affordable following World War
   I, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The American company White

   Approximately 5.4 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of
   food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the US as

   have inspired many local government officials in the United States to
   propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are

   Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers that promise
   quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a "drive-through"
   service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles.
   Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat
--
   from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

   Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on
   the go," often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a
   finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and
   chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries,
   onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream,
   though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like chili,
   mashed potatoes, and salads.
