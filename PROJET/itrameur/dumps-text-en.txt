   Ready-to-eat food or drink on a street

   Street food in New York City
   Street food in Yangon Chinatown, Myanmar

   Street food is ready-to-eat food or drinks sold by a hawker, or vendor,
   in a street or at other public places, such as markets or fairs. It is
   often sold from a portable food booth,^[1] food cart, or food truck and
   is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but
   many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are
   classified as both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper
   than restaurant meals. The types of street food widely vary between
   regions and cultures in different countries around the world.^[2]
   According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization,
   2.5 billion people eat street food every day.^[3] A majority of
   middle-income consumers^[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service
   of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in
   developing countries.

   Today, governments and other organizations are increasingly concerned
   with both the socioeconomic importance of street food, and with its
   associated risks. These risks include food safety, sanitation issues,
   illegal use of public or private areas, social problems and traffic
   congestion.^[4]

History[edit]

   or carrying baskets using a rod
   The presence of street food vendors in New York City throughout much of
   its history, such as these circa 1906, are credited with helping
   support the city's rapid growth.

Europe[edit]

   In ancient Greece, small fried fish was a street food,^[5] however, the
   Greek philosopher Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low
   regard.^[6] Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was
   discovered during the excavation of Pompeii.^[7] Street food was widely
   consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes
   did not have ovens or hearths.^[8] Chickpea soup^[9] with bread and
   grain paste^[10] were common meals. In ancient China, street food
   generally catered to the poor, though wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their
   homes.^[8]

   A travelling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in
   Cairo, people brought picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the
   streets and sit on while they ate their meals of lamb kebabs, rice, and
   fritters they purchased from street vendors.^[11] In Renaissance
   Turkey, many crossroads had vendors selling "fragrant bites of hot
   meat," including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted.^[11] In
   1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and
   standardize street food.^[12]

   In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold
   gingerbread nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other
   meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside.^[13] French
   fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a
   street food in Paris in the 1840s.^[14] Street foods in Victorian
   London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and
   jellied eels.^[15]

Americas[edit]

   Aztec marketplaces had vendors who sold beverages such as atolli ("a
   gruel made from maize dough"), almost 50 types of tamales (with
   ingredients that ranged from the meat of turkey, rabbit, gopher, frog
   and fish to fruits, eggs and maize flowers),^[16] as well as insects
   and stews.^[17] Spanish colonization brought European food stocks like
   wheat, sugarcane and livestock to Peru, but most commoners continued to
   primarily eat their traditional diets. Imports were only accepted at
   the margins of their diet, for example, grilled beef hearts sold by
   street vendors.^[18] Some of Lima's 19th-century street vendors such as
   "Erasmo, the 'negro' sango vendor" and Na Aguedita are still remembered
   today.^[19]

   During the American Colonial period, "street vendors sold oysters,
   roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes."
   Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until
   around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise.^[20]
   Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After
   previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food
   vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707.^[21] Many
   women of African descent made their living selling street foods in
   America in the 18th and 19th centuries, with products ranging from
   fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines and
   other sweets in New Orleans.^[22] Cracker Jack started as one of many
   street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.^[23]

Asia[edit]

   The selling of street food in China stretches back millennia and became
   an integral part of Chinese food culture during the Tang Dynasty.
   Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with
   regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary
   tourism.^[24] Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has
   had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced
   the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street
   food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers
   imported from China during the late 19th century.^[25]

   Ramen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100
   years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However,
   it soon became a "national dish" and even acquired regional
   variations.^[26]

   Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of
   Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the
   early 1960s,^[27] when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the
   street food culture, and by the 1970s it had "displaced
   home-cooking."^[28] As a result, many Thai street foods are derived
   from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine.^[29] About 76% of urban
   residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of
   the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity
   of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone
   generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee,
   Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects
   the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually
   from 2020 forward.^[30] Multiple studies showed that contamination of
   food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the
   contamination at restaurants.^[31] An estimated 2% or 160,000 vendors
   provide street food for Bangkok's 8 million people.^[32]

   In Delhi, India, it is said that ugh kings used to visit the kebab
   vendors on the street, which you can still visit to this day. During
   the colonial times, fusion street food was created, which was made with
   British customers in mind.^[33]

   In Indonesia — especially Java, traveling food and drink vendors have a
   long history, as they were described in temples bas reliefs dated from
   9th century, as well as mentioned in 14th century inscription as a line
   of work. In Indonesia, street food is sold from carts and bicycles.
   During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several
   street food were developed and documented, including satay and dawet
   (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's
   vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization
   in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service
   sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban
   agglomerations, especially in Greater Jakarta, Bandung and
   Surabaya.^[34] Some cultures consider rude walking on the street while
   eating.^[31]

   Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly
   between regions and cultures.^[2]

   Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being "fresh
   and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing]
   heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of
   Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste and fish
   sauce."^[35] Street food in Thailand offers a varied selection of
   ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks. The capital of Thailand,
   Bangkok, has been listed as one of the best places for street
   food.^[36]^[37] Popular street offerings in Bangkok include pad thai
   (stir fried rice noodle), green papaya salad, sour tom yum soup, Thai
   curries and mango sticky rice.

   Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese,
   and Dutch influences.^[38] Indonesian street food is often strongly
   flavored and spicy. Much of the street food in Indonesia is fried, such
   as fritters, nasi goreng and ayam goreng. Bakso (meatball soup), satay
   (skewered chicken) and gado-gado (vegetable salad served in peanut
   sauce) are also popular.^[39]

   There is a stigma in Japan against eating on the move. However, during
   special occasions such as festivals, the streets of Tokyo are filled
   with vendors that serve food such as odango, sashimi, oyster, and
   octopus.

   Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its
   own specialities to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes
   are vada pav, misal pav, chole bhature, parathas, bhel puri, sev puri,
   gol gappa, aloo tikki, kebabs, tandoori chicken, samosas, kachori,
   idli, pohe, egg bhurji, pav bhaji, pulaw, pakora, lassi, kulfi and
   falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly
   known as nukkadwala food ("corner" food). In South India, foods like
   mirchi bajji, punugulu, and mokkajonna (corn roasted on coal) are
   common street foods, along with breakfast items like idli, dosa and
   bonda. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to
   sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken their
   inspiration from the street food of India.^[40]

   In the Middle East falafel is very popular. Vendors sell it on street
   corners in Israel, Egypt, and Syria. Another food sold commonly on the
   street in Egypt is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish.^[41]

   In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passers-by to purchase sausages and
   hot dogs.

   In the Caribbean Islands a traditional dish is Jamaican jerk chicken.
   The original marinade calls for Caribbean ingredients such as scotch
   bonnet peppers, allspice berries and sometimes wood from laurel
   trees.^[42]

   Mexican street food is known as antojitos (translated as "little
   cravings") and features several varieties of tacos, such as tacos al
   pastor, as well as huaraches and other maize based foods.

   New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, but New York
   street food also includes everything from spicy Middle Eastern falafel
   or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles ^[35]

   In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of "plate lunch" (rice,
   macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the
   Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.^[43]

Cultural and economic aspects[edit]

   Because of differences in culture, social stratification, and history,
   the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally
   created and run vary in different areas of the world.^[44] Often,
   women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender
   equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street
   vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street
   food trade.^[45] Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes
   towards meals is one "cultural factor operating in the street food
   phenomenon" in the Philippines because eating "food out in the open, in
   the market or street or field" is "not at odds with the meal indoors or
   at home" where "there is no special room for dining".^[13]

   Other cultural phenomena that affect the street food market include the
   cultural implications of eating while walking down the street. In some
   cultures, this is considered to be rude,^[46] such as Japanese^[47] or
   Swahili cultures. Despite not being allowed for adults, it is
   culturally acceptable for children to do.^[48] In India, Henrike Donner
   wrote about a "marked distinction between food that could be eaten
   outside, especially by women," and the food prepared and eaten at home,
   with some non-Indian food being too "strange" or tied too closely to
   non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.^[49]

   In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce
   economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors
   purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the
   area have expanded.^[50] In the United States, street food vendors are
   credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying
   meals for the city's merchants and workers.^[51] Proprietors of street
   food in the United States have had a goal of upward mobility, moving
   from selling on the street to their own shops.^[52] However, in Mexico,
   an increase in street vendors has been seen as a sign of deteriorating
   economic conditions in which food vending is the only employment
   opportunity that unskilled labor who have migrated from rural areas to
   urban areas are able to find.^[17]

   In 2002, Coca-Cola reported that China, India, and Nigeria were some of
   its fastest-growing markets: markets where the company's expansion
   efforts included training and equipping mobile street vendors to sell
   its products.^[50]

   The libertarian Reason magazine states that in US cities, food trucks
   are subject to regulations designed to prevent them from competing with
   brick and mortar restaurants. For example, in Chicago, a regulation
   prevents food trucks "...from selling food within 200 feet of
   brick-and-mortar restaurants and, hence, prohibit them from operating
   throughout the city's downtown area," which critics have called an
   "anti-competitive" rule for food truck operators.^[53]

   Since 1984, Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco is home of one of the
   most diverse street food fairs.^[54] In addition to much leather, and
   people in various states of dress and undress, the event features an
   outdoor food court serving a variety of street food. For donations of
   $10 or more, visitors get a $2 discount on each drink purchased at the
   fair. In 2018, the street photographer Michael Rababy documented it in
   his book, Folsom Street Food Court.^[54]^[55]

   Netflix has also featured the street foods of the world through its TV
   series Street Food, with the first volume focusing on Asia, and the
   second on Latin America.^[56]^[57]^[58]

Health and safety[edit]

   As early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food
   vendor activities.^[11] With the increasing pace of globalization and
   tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns
   of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise
   public awareness.^[59]^[60]^[61] However, despite concerns about
   contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low,
   with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.^[43]

   In Singapore, street food vendors known as "hawkers", over half of
   which were unlicensed, were considered "primarily a nuisance to be
   removed from the streets".^[62] 113 hawker centres were constructed
   between 1971 and 1986 to remove hawkers from the streets while
   preserving the food culture.^[62]

   In 2002, a sampling of 511 street foods in Ghana by the World Health
   Organization showed that most had microbial counts within the accepted
   limits,^[63] and a different sampling of 15 street foods in Calcutta
   showed that they were "nutritionally well balanced", providing roughly
   200 kcal (Cal) of energy per rupee of cost.^[64]

   In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided
   comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and
   retailers of the street food sector since 2000.^[65] Other effective
   ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping
   programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing
   and membership management programs, and technical testing
   programs.^[66]^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]

   In India, government recognized the fundamental rights of the street
   food vendors and have imposed reasonable restrictions. And in 2006,
   India legislature has enacted the food Safety and Standards Act to
   monitor the quality of food.^[71]

   Despite knowledge of the risk factors, actual harm to consumers’ health
   is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in
   tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up
   studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and
   food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been
   devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness.
   The fact that social and geographical origins largely determine
   consumers’ physiological adaptation and reaction to foods—whether
   contaminated or not—is neglected in the literature.^[72]

   In the late 1990s, the United Nations and other organizations began to
   recognize that street vendors had been an underused method of
   delivering fortified foods to populations, and in 2007, the UN Food and
   Agriculture Organization recommended considering methods of adding
   nutrients and supplements to street foods that are commonly consumed by
   the particular culture.^[43]

   Portion size to calorie intake, study sheds light on how fast food is
   causing various lifestyle diseases

   Changes in portion sizes, energy contents and nutrient profiles of fast
   food over the last 30 years shows how these have led to lifestyle
   diseases.

   Till now, research has revolved around trans-fat, high intake of sugars
   and salt leading to cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, etc.
   However, according to a study, by Boston University and Tufts
   University, comparison between the portion size and calorie intake from
   fast food, between 1986 and 2016, shows a drastic increase in all the
   parameters.

   However, there has been an increase in levels of calcium and iron,
   especially in desserts, according to the study that looked at fast food
   brands like, McDonald’s, Dairy Queen and KFC. On average per decade,
   the daily value of calcium increased by 3.9 per cent in desserts and
   the daily value of iron increased 1.4 per cent.

   Even though this rise could be good for treating anaemia and calcium
   deficiency, “people should not be consuming fast food to get more
   calcium and iron in their diet because of the high calories and sodium
   that come along with it,” Megan McCrory, lead author of the study, was
   quoted as saying in a report.

   The report analysed 1,787 menu items and grouped the items into
   — entrées, sides, and desserts. It notes that while entrées gained an
   average of 30 calories per decade, sides did not increase much in
   calories but became saltier.

   It assumes importance as nearly 36 per cent of adults in the US consume
   fast food. “Between 1986 and 2016, the number of items offered on
   restaurant menus grew a staggering 226 per cent, an average of 22.9
   items per year. Along with the menu expansions, researchers found that
   portion sizes and calories had increased as well,” McCrory was quoted
   as saying.

   Advent of fast food in India

   In India, increase in disposable income has in turn increased the
   frequency of dinning out. Big fast food chains like McDonald’s came to
   India in 1996, and soon other big outlets like Dominos, Pizza Hut, KFC,
   etc, followed suit, according to a study by AIIMS, Bangalore.

   According to another report, Indian fast food market is expected to
   grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent by 2020 due
   to changing consumer behaviour and demography.

   This indicates that India is sailing in the same boat as US when it
   comes to fast food consumption. The latest findings should be taken as
   a benchmark and, we should work towards cutting down the fast food
   consumption in order to lead a healthy life.

Fast Food Onslaught on Culinary Culture

Fast food chains have launched an onslaught on our traditional food habits,
especially of our youth. Healthy eating behaviours should be kindled during
childhood by fostering a feeling of pride in our local food culture and by
promoting their health benefits

   One pizza a month,” reads a wedding contract signed by newlyweds of
   Assam in their mid-twenties. Mintu Rai, 25, married his college
   sweetheart and “a pizza freak” 24-year-old Shanti Prasad in June 2022
   and the 16-second video of the bride and the groom signing the piece of
   paper has been viewed 45 million times on Instagram, reads a report in
   the BBC news portal on July 17 this year.

   The story also quotes Raghav Thakur, the couple’s friend and the brain
   behind the surprise wedding contract. “She takes it as a joke. She
   keeps complaining that she’s put on 3-4 kg in the past few years, but I
   don’t think that she’s really serious about cutting down on her pizza
   consumption,” he says, laughing.

   He’s right, says Shanti, and adds, “We’ve already had pizzas twice
   since the wedding and it’s only been two weeks.”

   It is easy to laugh and shrug off the above anecdote, but in reality,
   it is no laughing matter. It speaks volumes about how fast food has
   seeped into Indian culture and has altered the eating habits of our
   future – our youth. It also tells us about the addictive nature of fast
   foods and the link between fast food and weight gain or obesity.

   Such a radical change in the eating habits of a population is a clear
   sign of a cultural loss leading to the complete desertion of culinary
   traditions. Across the nation, millions, perhaps billions, are
   currently developing tastes that will sustain for the rest of their
   lives – one of the great American conquests of our time. McDonald’s,
   Pizza Hut, KFC, and other stereotypical American fast-food chains stay
   popular and their offerings go very well with the modern lifestyle of
   Indians. All of the top 10 fast-food brands in the world have their
   roots in the US.

   Fast Food Kills

   There can be no discussions about the fact that fast food is not
   healthy — in fact it kills.
   [INS: :INS]

   Worldwide, regardless of whether you eat it or not, fast food and its
   consequences have become inescapable. They are definitely ruining the
   health of young consumers. If someone calls this as the unhealthiest
   generation the world has ever seen, we should further add the dire
   truth that this generation is going to have a shorter lifespan compared
   to their parents, in spite of all the advances in medicine and health
   care.

   As a society, we are ﬂooded with research reports telling us how the
   quick and tasty bites at fast food restaurants are killing us slowly.
   Bad diet is a bigger killer than any other risk factor in the world. It
   is not the pathogens in food that are shortening our life span, but it
   is the super-sized servings of unhealthy, non-nutritious food.

Fast food can make you impatient

   Merely thinking about fast food can make you feel hurried. Just looking
   at the logos of fast-food companies is enough to affect our attitude
   and judgment. Diﬃcult to believe? But these are the results reported by
   researchers at the University of Toronto, published in March 2010 issue
   of Psychological Science. They found that people who spent time
   examining leading fast-food logos were more likely to exhibit
   impatience and rush in executing subsequent tasks, compared with a
   control group that viewed unrelated shapes of similar size and the
   logos of inexpensive sit-down chain restaurants.

   In another experiment, two groups of people – one group who
   subconsciously viewed fast-food logos and the other who were not
   exposed to the logos – were given the task of reading certain passages
   with no time limit. The group that viewed the logos of the fast food
   companies subconsciously read the passages more quickly as compared to
   the group that were not exposed to the logos. Researchers also found
   that households with more fast-food restaurants in the neighbourhood
   have lower levels of savings, even after accounting for variables like
   income, education, and socialisation than those with fewer fast-food
   outlets.

   According to ‘Global Burden of Disease Study’ by the US-based Institute
   for Health Metrics and Evaluation, unhealthy eating killed 11 million
   people in 2017, up from 8 million in 1990, while smoking kills only
   about 8 million people a year.

   The changing eating habits are already starting to show their impact on
   our health. India is facing a tsunami of non-communicable diseases
   (NCDs). Children and youth are falling victim to diseases that were
   previously never seen in those age groups, like type 2 diabetes and
   fatty liver disease. There is also a manifestation of increased rates
   of adult diseases like hypertension or coronary artery diseases in the
   young.

   Fast food impairs cognitive and mental health
   [INS: :INS]

   Even though it has long been established that diet impacts physical
   health issues – including risk for conditions like obesity, heart
   disease, and diabetes – the idea that food may aﬀect cognitive and
   mental health is a relatively new area of medicine.

   For many years, the medical ﬁeld was unaware of or did not fully
   acknowledge the connection between our brain functions and the food we
   consume. But today, fortunately enough, there is a ﬂood of information
   on this subject.

   A number of studies have been published recently in reputed
   international journals investigating connection between food and brain
   functions have determined that sugar and junk food shrinks the brain,
   limits learning and memory, impairs cognition, is addictive, negatively
   impacts mood, even heightens the risk for degenerative brain diseases
   like Alzheimer’s.

   This is very significant considering the fact that 70 per cent of
   mental health problems arise during adolescence. It is a known fact
   today that the processed foods lead not only to functional changes but
   also structural changes in the brain and these changes occur much
   before the development of apparent changes in the body like obesity.

   Obesity: An Emerging Health Crisis

   India today is not only the fifth economic power also it has broken
   into the top five countries in terms of adult obesity. Obesity is
   mainly a problem of modern India, teeming with fast food outlets and
   American-style malls.

   The prevalence of obesity among Indians increased in 2019-21 compared
   to 2015-16, as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data.
   Nearly one in every four persons is overweight compared to one in every
   five earlier. Also, according to UNICEF’s World Obesity Atlas for 2022,
   India is predicted to have one in 10 obese children globally, by 2030.

   Obesity increases the risk of NCDs, including type-2 diabetes, 13 types
   of cancer, heart problems and lung conditions, leading to premature
   deaths. Multiple studies have shown the association of paediatric and
   adolescent obesity with obesity in adults. Almost half of overweight
   adults were overweight as children.

   Obesity is by far the single most serious medical condition faced by
   children today. The gravity of the situation faced by obese children
   was well brought out in a report published in the Journal of the
   American Medical Association that equated the quality of life of an
   obese child with that of a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.

   All health problems are sad, but it is particularly regrettable that so
   many otherwise healthy children are being burdened from such an early
   age by a totally preventable health condition.

   Lure Tactics

   In the early 1990s, a dashing young model zoomed her way into Indian
   living rooms, endorsing a carbonated drink laden with sugars. The
   epoch-making advertisement continues to be remembered even today and is
   cited as one of the successes of the Indian ad world. Even while
   acknowledging the creativity and effort that went behind it, what
   should not be forgotten is how it came to influence our Indian palate.
   It told young gullible viewers that consuming carbon-high drinks was
   indeed a right choice!

   It will bring a smile to our dear readers when they know that India is
   growing younger, when the world is getting older. The average Indian
   was only 29 years old in 2020, one of the youngest in the world. By
   2030, the average age in India will become 29.7 years.

   In 2030, India with a population of 1.4 billion and younger than any
   other major economy in the world, will have tremendous opportunity for
   both economic progress and improvement in the general wellbeing of its
   citizens.

   A more interesting development will be by 2030; when Internet will be
   accessed by more than one billion Indians, both rural and urban as well
   as old and young. Accordingly, nine out of 10 children above the age of
   15 will be online. While this is a great achievement, it is also the
   target population of the global fast food companies, who will step up
   their marketing efforts to reach them. The Internet and social media
   are the latest armours at the disposal of the fast food companies. Not
   surprisingly, the fast-food industry is the sector with the highest
   online engagement rates.

   An added advantage for them is that 80 per cent or more of the Indian
   population access internet through their mobile phones, which is
   expected to increase to more than 90 per cent over the coming years.
   This will be a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent proﬁle of connected consumers
   compared to the US, the UK and even China where nearly half of Internet
   users today access the web primarily through desktops.

   The fast-food industry has effectively leveraged factors such as
   demographic dividend, deepening technology and Internet penetration,
   growth in organised retail, convenience and changing consumer
   consumption patterns.

   According to American Dietetic Association, exposure of children to
   food commercials for just 30 seconds is enough to influence their food
   choices. Children see thousands of slick, clever, appealing
   advertisements each week. Armed with sophisticated psychological
   research and marketing techniques, fast-food industry target children
   in the global digital media landscape. In this area, both children and
   food marketers are active, while parents have little awareness.

   The prevailing pattern of food and beverage consumption of youth and
   children in India who represent the major demographic share of our
   population, is at best, a missed opportunity, and, at worst, a direct
   threat to the future of the nation.

   In most countries, healthcare and welfare systems are legal pyramid
   schemes; that is, lots of young, healthy people, ﬁnancially sound are
   at the bottom and the few old, sick people are at the top. What if the
   country’s healthcare system becomes overburdened by the inﬂux of young
   patients? Without a solid foundation, the whole pyramid collapses, and
   that is really what seems imminent.

   It is a matter of sadness that Western foods have now transformed into
   the ‘new traditional Indian diet’ of the country’s youth. The
   demographic and digital advantage that the nation has at present should
   not get destroyed through mindless junk eating.

   War is not lost yet

   What is needed to thwart this increasing inclination for consumption of
   fast foods is a massive awareness about our traditional food systems,
   its advantages and the vital role it has played in up keeping the
   health of our elderly.

   Traditional Indian food has always been about abundance and
   wholesomeness, with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fat
   and other nutrients to meet the body’s requirements. A regular Indian
   home-cooked meal contains various staples like rice, chapati, daal and
   curry along with pickles, chutneys, papads, salad and raita. The family
   meal is also about socialising and strengthening ties between the
   members who share the meal.

Fast foods make the brain shrink

   Your pancreas produces more insulin when you eat lots of fatty fast
   food. It is well known that increased insulin production can lead to
   insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Much scarier is the fact that
   it could also lead you to dementia. Insulin resistance aﬀects brain’s
   ability to create and store memories, thereby increasing the risk of
   dementia. Researchers even call Alzheimer’s ‘the diabetes of the
   brain’. The hippocampus helps us control short-term and long-term
   memories. With a functioning hippocampus, we receive
   fullness-signalling messages from the gut and the memories related to
   food may get blocked so that we are not tempted to eat by the sight,
   smell, or thought of something delicious. Once the hippocampus is
   damaged, people feel hungry all the time, leading to obesity.
   A study published in the Royal Society Open Science in 2020 by a few
   researchers from Macquarie University in Sydney examined the eﬀects
   that fast food can have on our mental state, its functions, and their
   results. The shocking result was that it takes only a week for these
   processed foods especially the western style meal to have a notable
   eﬀect in the hippocampus region of the brain leading to a cycle of
   fast-food binging and overeating.

   India still has the advantage as we have not lost our culture of real
   food. Home cooking has not stopped altogether and there are millions
   still who eat frugal but nutritious home-cooked meals with local
   ingredients.

     The fast-food industry has effectively leveraged factors such as
     demographic dividend, deepening technology and Internet penetration,
     growth in organised retail, convenience and changing consumer
     consumption patterns

   Dietary patterns that begin in childhood give shape to the health
   profiles of the population at all ages. Healthy eating behaviours
   should be kindled during childhood by fostering a feeling of pride in
   our local food culture and by promoting their health benefits.
   Involving children in all stages of traditional meal preparation can
   promote a sense of pride; it can also go a long way in fostering the
   pristine connections between nutrition, nature and livelihoods.

   We have fought invasions, survived their lasting impacts and
   successfully regained lost glories. But today, we seem to be succumbing
   slowly to the pressure of the new invasion, the fast-food culture. Just
   as the East India Company drained wealth of its colonies, now these
   fast food and soft drink multi-nationals are draining the wealth and
   health of our nation.

   As we step into the ‘Amrit Kaal’ – the next 25 years leading to the
   centenary of Indian Independence – as highlighted by our Prime Minister
   Shri Narendra Modi, crafting an environment in which children and youth
   can grow up healthy should be a high priority for the nation if we are
   to have a healthy nation in 2047. For that it is very important to tell
   the fast-food industries to stop playing with human lives. The march of
   armies of the colossal fast-food empire, which has taken vast swathes
   of the globe under its dominion can be stopped in this land, where
   enormous diversity in traditional food culture still continues. This is
   possible only if there is strong public and political will.

   Good food is not the one which is just good for you, but good for the
   society, nation and environment. We need to go back to good food
   practices TODAY for no child should ever die early – or even have to
   suffer – from a condition that is completely preventable.

Traditional food better than Fast Food

   [This thread wins a special prize for the TOW May 4th -10th]
   Do you think traditional is food better than fast food? How?
   Generally food prepared at home is hygienic and healthy. The results of
   recent food surveys show that people are more addicted to fast food
   than our Indian traditional food items. This is well-known by the
   increasing number of McDonald, KFC fast foods.
   How many of us are interested to eat our traditional food like cereals,
   pulses, whole grains etc. How many parents are giving traditional food
   practice to their children?
   Go back to traditional food and reduce the risk of diseases.

   Agree. Fast food has following problem. Fast food is expensive. Fast
   food has no personal touch and looks and tastes like factory food.
   There is no human connection made in between the fast food. So
   basically we are paying for plastic food and not much getting in terms
   of experience and satisfaction. I wonder why we even eat it or more
   likely choose to eat it because others are eating it out of fashion. We
   also spend the money in excess on such food which we should be saving.
   That is what I personally think about such type of the food.

   Great topic and thread you have posted here. It is a well know fact
   that traditional food are very better than the junk food produced by
   this modern day eatry joints. Fast food is the result of laziness on
   the part of us. The current thread of sickness and disease are as a
   result of these fast foods we now eat. But if we go back to our root
   and eat our traditional foods, sickness and disease like diabetes,
   cholera, cancer to mention a few will never overpower us again.

   Fast food joints helps the lazy who have their 'hands tied' by busyness
   of work culture. They crumble all that is served without a iota of care
   about the hygiene or inputs into preparation. No fast food is prepared
   without preservatives which harm our health. Traditional food however
   are prepared with utmost care and love using good quality inputs to
   care our health. It is in our benefit to turn traditional or else place
   our health in the hand of doctors.

   Most of the fast foods are made by frying and using a lot of oil which
   makes them tasty but they are very harmful for health. Fast foods can
   cause various problems like obesity, constipation and heart problems.
   On the other hand traditional foods are good for health and also
   nutritious. Fast foods are vary high in calories and need some very
   good exercise to digest. So if you eat the fast foods then make sure
   you exercise.

   Mathi Gopal, I always prefers to eat traditional food and that too
   prepared at home. Yes at present days majority of people mainly the
   youngsters are choosing fastfood instead of traditional food. They have
   certain reasons for going towards fastfood but it already proved that
   fastfood is not good for us. People on regular eating of fastfood will
   face obesity and other health related hazards, hence one should avoid
   the habit of regular eating of fastfood instead one can go for it
   rarely. Individuals should always give priority to traditional food.

Theme:

     * Fast foods are the foods that are quickly prepared or pre-prepared
       and served at restaurants. Most of these foods contain high sugars
       or high fats or high sodium levels. The consumers of fast foods are
       increasing at a rapid rate.

Effects of fast-food culture:

     * Due to high sugars or salts or fats in fast foods, the regular
       consumers will have to face several health issues such as high
       blood pressure, obesity and other lifestyle diseases.
     * The fast-food can also affect our brains and make us crave more
       unhealthy food.
     * Fast foods satisfy hunger but it rarely provides us with enough
       nutrition.
     * Due to the emerging fast-food culture, people are not motivated to
       cook healthy meals, which take plenty of time to prepare.

Reasons for the growth of fast food culture:

     * The pre-prepared foods save a lot of time. In hectic lifestyles,
       saving time is a priority and hence the consumption of fast foods
       is increasing.
     * The easy availability of fast-food restaurants is also increasing
       the consumption of such foods.
     * Advertisements of fast food companies show that consuming their
       food products is a cool thing. Fear of missing out can motivate
       youngsters to consume food products.
     * Increasing income of middle-class people is resulting in the
       availability of disposable income. This is also one of the reasons
       for the emerging fast-food culture.
     * As people are now more aware of the importance of healthy foods,
       fast food chains are coming up with healthy options. But most of
       those products are also unhealthy and contain high fats and sodium.

How can we get rid of fast food culture:

     * There should be restrictions on advertisements that promote fast
       food consumption.
     * There is a need to take steps to promote a healthy lifestyle.
       Moreover, healthy food should be much cheaper than fast food.
     * Widespread awareness programs on the ill effects of fast foods
       should be conducted. And it should be made compulsory to provide
       nutritional facts labels.
     * There should be a limit on the number of fast foods restaurants per
       area.
     * Parents and teachers should guide kids and teenagers about the
       effects of consuming fast food and the importance of eating healthy
       food.

Conclusion:

   Fast-food consumption is linked to lifestyle diseases. So, there should
   be restrictions on advertisements that promote fast food consumption.
   There is a need to take steps to promote a healthy lifestyle.

Fast food the Indian way

   McSpicy &amp; McVeggie

   Almost every time we think about Fast Food, American chain restaurants
   come to mind. Fast food restaurants have been springing up across the
   world for decades now and are an integral part of the culinary scene in
   most countries. In India, the fast food industry has had a hard time
   getting going because most people had their own way of cooking and were
   not ready to change their habits. But nowadays, the industry is growing
   rapidly as more and more people (especially among the youth) become
   passionate about fast food.

   McSpicy &amp; McVeggie

   International chains such as McDonald’s, have adapted their menu to the
   Indian populace’s taste  in order to thrive. They spiced their dishes
   up, added more vegetarian options and adapted their prices to the
   population’s regular cost of living. Certainly, Indians have developed
   a taste for western-style fast food but they have different
   sensitivities so the chains have to  “Indianise”  themselves.

   Doing so, McDonald’s took into account that Indians don’t eat beef or
   pork because of their religion or beliefs, hence the creation of
   special dishes including the McSpicy (a spicy paneer burger), the
   McVeggie (speaks for itself) and Aloo Tikki (North Indian snack).

   That’s all very well and thoughtful but people might wonder why they
   should eat spiced up versions of western food when they have Indian
   fast food offering Asian dishes. Indeed, reviews of the McSpicy suggest
   that it is not that spicy for the Indian palette.  So what about
   home-grown alternatives?

   Traditionally in India, fast food can be found on the road side and
   most of the outlets in India are independent establishments not chains
   or franchises.

   But still, some chains are quite famous such as Darshini. In the
   mid-80’s, Darshini was set up in Bangalore City. People have to eat
   while standing and they have to buy a coupon before eating. Today there
   are more than 5,000 Darshinis in Bangalore. There are also food courts
   where small fast food outlets serve many different cuisines under one
   roof.

   So the success of McDonald’s lies in reproducing their menu everywhere
   in the world. They can create the exact same burger in the UK as in
   India but with Indian dishes, it is different. It is almost impossible
   to recreate the same curry twice – even if you follow the same recipe,
   the result won’t be exactly the same at the end, there are too many
   variables. This might explain why they are not so many chain
   restaurants in India. And long may that continue!

Our fast foods and their fast food​

   April 2002

   With the influx of western fast foods into India, one has a chance to
   compare our fast food with theirs.  And there are many reasons why I
   prefer our fare to theirs

   I ACKNOWLEDGED MYSELF AS A SUCCESSFUL nutritionist only recently, the
   day I received my son’s first e-mail from his college in the United
   States. Among the first things he says he is missing is his hitherto
   forced intake of fruits and vegetables. Am I pleased! To think that my
   teenager isn’t excited about pizzas and burgers! That’s quite an
   achievement for me, especially that now seven months after having been
   on campus he says, “I can’t look at another pizza or burger.”

   But since his two meals a day are paid for, he is stuck with
   institutional fare. Besides there isn’t much available on American
   campuses anyway other than more of the same. And since the closest
   supermarket is quite far away getting fresh fruits and edible
   vegetables is quite a problem. Recently over the phone he mentioned
   he’s eating cake for breakfast and it totally freaked this nutritionist
   mother until I realised he was kidding. But knowing how there is always
   some truth in a joke, I am quite sure that he wasn’t entirely joking
   either.

   Enough of sounding like a love-sick mother. I mention all this only to
   get to the issue of fast foods. With the influx of western fast foods
   into India one has had a chance to compare our traditional fast foods
   with theirs. And, there are many reasons why I prefer our fare to
   theirs.

   First, the word ‘fast food’ is misleading. Because generally speaking
   even traditional cuisine of society when delivered quickly in
   ready-to-eat style is loosely termed fast food. The actual
   pre-preparation of these foods is not fast at all. Only the
   over-the-counter serving of it is almost instant-aneous. I’m not
   talking about pre-packaged foods like Maggi noodles, ready mix soups or
   now even ready-mix dal and vegetables. The foods I’m referring to and
   comparing with western fast foods in this article are of
   the dosa and bhelpuri type which are served in a flash in the many
   formal and informal eateries that line the streets of India’s towns and
   cities.

   THE COMPARISON I AM MAKING IS ALSO NOT about hygiene because whether
   one eats at a 5-star restaurant, in a small roadside café, at a
   McDonalds or at a hawker’s roadside stall, one is always at the mercy
   of the cook, waiter and others involved in the service chain. Only in
   your own home can you have control over hygiene factors. Often even the
   eating places that look clean are only superficially so. And let’s not
   believe that in the West everything is perfect. My son has also
   informed me that it isn’t just traditional Indian cuisine that he is
   missing but also the clean home kitchen!

   And then of course there is the deeper question of what’s the benefit
   of all the hygiene in the world if food has been sprayed with
   pesticides and chemical fertilizers used in the soil to increase
   productivity and profitability. Worse still, what use all the washing
   and cleaning when the seeds used to grow the food on our tables are
   genetically modified?

   So all else apart, in terms of nutritional value Indian fast foods — be
   it a sandwich on the street, a packet of bhelpuri or a dosa — are
   better balanced than western fast foods like the hamburger or pizza and
   the accompanying cola without which washing it down is likely to prove
   difficult. And of course our kulfi beats their softees and other
   chemically processed desserts.

   Take for example the ubiquitous bhelpuri. There aren’t many who can
   resist this combination which is great as a snack anytime and can be a
   meal if one wants it to be. It’s base is puffed rice and gram flour
   which are both high value foods. To this is added fresh onion,
   coriander leaves, potato, chilli to taste, whole wheat puris and
   tamarind chutney. So in one serving you have vitamin C from the chilli
   and tamarind, and jaggery in the chutney invested with iron and energy.
   The wheat, rice and gram flour combine to give you protein. In fact all
   food groups are well-combined in this single dish! If a good medium is
   used to fry the flour and puri, even that would be beneficial as fat to
   you. In fact as I’ve always maintained if quality base ingredients, i.e
   right type of salt, sugar, cereal are used, the end result will always
   be a health food i.e a highly nutritious meal which is good for you.

   EVEN THE DOSA OR IDLI, ESPECIALLY IF MADE with par-boiled or unpolished
   rice is a complete meal of known and unknown ingredients. The
   accompaniment of chutney and vegetables makes it wholesome. If only
   restaurants would desist from cost-cutting by using the cheapest
   cooking oil! And if only every company vending refined oil would not
   let every restaurateur believe that theirs is the best cooking medium
   which is “good for health”.

   The simple vegetable sandwich of the roadside stalls and peanuts (with
   onion, coriander leaves and lemon) or roasted gram, are not only
   delicious indigenous fast foods, but also have nutritional value
   especially if the bread is whole grain. Even if not, it’s a much better
   bet than hot dogs, pretzels and the like.

   So recently when a friend was praising the hygiene at the local
   MacDonald’s I wondered which was the lesser of two evils when one is
   compelled to eat out: hygienically prepared junk food that won’t do you
   any good, or nutritious indigenous fast foods which may be hygienically
   suspect.

   As an Indian with strong intestinal flora, and as a nutritionist I
   always choose the latter. The first choice always  being food prepared
   at home, especially by my own hands. an Our fast foods and their fast

Post Highlight

   Street food is a great option if you want to cook your food and have it
   delivered to your door. Owning a restaurant has its perks over the
   street food business. However, the owners of both fields must be aware
   of the perks associated with each business. #ThinkWithNiche

   If you’re running a restaurant, you might be thinking about how to make
   the most of your profits. Street food, on the other hand, is a great
   option for people who want to cook their food and have it delivered to
   their customers. However, restaurant owners should be aware that there
   are several benefits to cooking street food instead of going to a
   restaurant. For one, restaurants can often cost more than cooking food
   from scratch. Additionally, restaurants can be difficult to manage and
   tend to be more stressful than cooking from scratch. Finally,
   restaurants often have high prices for food that isn’t as great as food
   cooked from scratch.

   Why Street Food is Better than Restaurant Food

   While you should keep some of the advantages of a restaurant like a
   convenience and quality of food, you should be aware that there are
   several reasons why street food is better than restaurant food.

    It’s affordable!

   One of the biggest advantages of street food is its affordability. You
   can often buy a dozen eggs or meatballs at your local market for less
   than $5. Additionally, people can eat street food at their own kitchen
   table rather than spending money on expensive seats or tables. It is
   means that the cost per person is generally less than a sit-down meal
   at a restaurant if you're strictly cooking from scratch.

   The Different Types of Street Food

   Street food differs from other types of food in that it’s usually
   cooked at street level, not at a restaurant. It is typically served
   with little or no preparation and doesn’t require refrigeration.

   For example, you might be able to find street food like tacos,
   burritos, and tamales at a local taco stand or a local convenience
   store. You can also buy street food at a local grocery store or deliver
   fresh ingredients to your home. Though you may have noticed that some
   of these foods are called “street food” or “fast food.” It is actually
   the wrong name. Street foods are often sold for a higher price than
   fast foods because they are prepared directly on the premises using
   fresh ingredients (versus frozen dough). Also, many restaurants don't
   serve these items as regularly as fast foods.

   How to Cook Street Food the Right Way

   If you cook your own food, you know exactly what ingredients go into it
   and how much they will cost. You can control the quality of the
   ingredients that you use while also controlling what portion sizes are
   sold at a specific store. Most importantly, if you cook your own food,
   you get to enjoy it just as it should be enjoyed: with friends and
   family around.

   The Benefits of Cooking from scratch at Home

   Having a homemade meal at home is one of the best ways to save money
   and enjoy your time with your family. A homemade meal can be as simple
   as making a sandwich or serving pasta, and it’s often much healthier
   than eating out. Additionally, by cooking from scratch at home, you can
   save on food costs. The first thing to consider is that restaurants
   usually have higher prices for food than homemade meals. For example, a
   French sauté chicken entrée at a restaurant may cost $12, whereas a
   homemade chicken dish could cost between $3 and $5. It may not seem
   like such a big difference until you compare it to the amount of food
   in one meal versus two meals bought at fast-food restaurants. When
   families go out to eat together they often buy extra food to share
   which results in them paying more per person than if they had bought
   their own meals instead. When families buy their own food, they can
   just sit down together and enjoy their meal without having to worry
   about how many pieces of bread they need or how much butter they will
   need next.

   Save Money on Your Menu and Ingredients

   When you cook from scratch, you know exactly what to use for your food
   and how to prepare it. But that doesn’t mean that you need to buy a
   bunch of expensive ingredients. You can easily save money on your menu
   and ingredients by cooking street food. You don’t have to eat at
   restaurants all the time. If you’re thinking about running a
   restaurant, there are plenty of options out there — fast food joints
   and coffee shops are just a couple of choices. However, if you want to
   cook at home instead of going out, it pays off in many different ways!
   You’ll save money with fewer calories (less processed foods) and more
   fresh produce (food grown in your own garden). You can also create new
   dishes without having to go through the trouble of getting ready-made
   meals or buying premade recipes for every meal.

   Enjoy More Delicious Foods with No Extra Work

   The main benefit of cooking food from scratch is that you can enjoy
   more delicious foods. You don’t have to spend a lot of money
   on expensive ingredients when you cook from scratch. When you go to the
   store and buy your food, the foods are already pre-prepared and
   packaged. Cooking from scratch allows you to make fresh, flavorful food
   with little effort. You can also save money on groceries because you
   can use fresh produce instead of buying pre-packaged items like fruit
   and vegetables. Additionally, restaurant owners should note that
   preparing food from scratch means they have time to do other things
   like sleep, exercise, or play with their children after work.

   The pricing strategy in Mcdonald’s India is so different from other
   countries. Can a popular American franchise like McDonald’s really
   serve burgers to a country that’s pretty much vegetarian?

   Will culture and religion be surmountable challenges for this fast-food
   giant or will they find their costs spiralling out of control as they
   build their business in a totally different market?


   In this article, we will take a close look at how McDonald’s is
   currently building its franchise in India. Also, we will share with you
   the pricing strategy of McDonald’s in India.  In addition, we’ll look
   at how the fast-food giant is competing with local traditions, cultural
   differences and existing competition to establish their global
   McDonald’s brand.

How McDonald’s Entered India


   Amit Jatia is the man behind the phenomenal growth of McDonald’s in
   India.


   In 1994, the American fast-food giant first contacted him persuading
   his vegetarian family to invest in the business.


   Amit said that he and his family had to think about it carefully since
   nearly half of Indians are vegetarians. They were only convinced to
   invest when McDonald’s told them that they are willing to localise.
   They assured them that there would be no pork or beef on the menu.


   McDonald’s signature product is Big Mac beef burger which is known
   across the world. Considering that India will not serve beef or pork as
   80% of the population revere cows as sacred. They came up with their
   own signature product which is the mutton-based Maharajah Mac as
   opposed to its famous beef-based Big Mac.


   There were challenges in entering the market. Based on McDonald’s
   survey on the Indian market, they learned that Indians wanted to try
   and taste American fast food, however, it should not be a replacement
   for their food. Therefore, McDonald’s need to adapt to Indian taste if
   they want to succeed in India. They had to customize their burgers to
   suit Indians’ taste and a hyper price-sensitive market. Another thing
   was that half of its population is vegetarian, a separate menu had to
   be created or served.


   What’s So Good on the Pricing Strategy of McDonald’s India? What’s So
   Good on the Pricing Strategy of McDonald’s India?


Localisation and Competition against the traditional street vendors


Competition against street vendors


   There is plenty of existing competition in the Indian fast food space.
   McDonald’s has had to compete with a range of alternatives to maintain
   control of the Indian market. India’s street food, for example, has
   many forms and varieties, and it’s very popular amongst Indian people.


   Generally speaking, though, when a fast-food chain gives Indians what
   they want (listed above), they do quite well in India, both in
   financial terms as well as in popularising its quick service culture
   among the population.


   Fast food is very popular in India. What’s more, India’s fast food
   industry is growing quickly. It’s now at 40% per annum, generating over
   Rs. 4800 cores in sales and over Rs. 7000 cores in multinational
   segments.


   There are also unique varieties of fast food in different states of
   India which can be difficult to serve well and are generally much
   cheaper than a McDonald’s meal. For example, the most authentic cuisine
   is Indian street food and can be bought for a few rupees from portable
   stalls found in the Indian cities and towns.


   Street vendors are a serious competitor to McDonald’s in India. Street
   vendors offer hot fresh, enticing snacks which many people really enjoy
   and prefer. These street foods are popular mainly because they are
   available at half the price of any restaurant food, including
   McDonald’s.


   Take-out food, fast food, and snacks are easily available which is
   another factor undermining McDonald’s convenience offer. It doesn’t
   take much time to prepare street food either, so vendors present a very
   convenient and tasty eating option.


Localisation


   Amit confessed that McDonald’s adapting for the uniquely Indian market
   was expensive, however, it has paid off in the long term.


   There was no supply chain for lettuce in India when they were just
   starting. Many people used cabbage instead of lettuce on burgers. So,
   they had to start from the very beginning.


   They introduced a burger called Aloo Tikki Burger for 20 rupees (20p).
   It is made with a cutlet of mashed potatoes, peas and seasoned with
   Indian spices. This is McDonald’s India version of street food. It was
   a hit – with the taste, value and price they introduced to the market.
   It radically changed India’s industry.


   Says Edward Dixon, chief operating officer of Sannam S4, that provides
   market entry advice and support (for multinationals in India, Brazil
   and China):


   “Localised menu, delivered with precision quality at a price that
   works. One other trick they have used very effectively [is] an entry
   level ice cream which fuels the ability for consumers who might not
   ordinarily be able to afford to become a customer.”


   In 2001, they began to localise all the kitchen equipment to make a
   burger. They had to take a burger apart, piece by piece and made every
   component local. Even the furnitures, chillers, freezers and
   refrigeration are made locally. Their global suppliers have worked with
   local businesses in most cases to make that happen.


   Moreover, India demands that McDonald’s offers vegetable products which
   are 100% vegetarian. They want McDonald’s to abide by strict food
   preparation requirements and a vegetarian menu. This includes:


     * different food groups to be prepared separately using dedicated
       equipment and utensils
     * cooking oils that are strictly vegetarian oils – not animal-based
       oils
     * cheese and sauces that are completely vegetarian and egg-less

Diversified Product Range


   McDonald’s India has a diversity of product range focusing on
   vegetarian products because most Indians are vegetarian. They
   introduced several products that are spicy and tasty according to
   Indians’ preference since they like spicy foods.


   To accommodate vegetarian customers, they came up with vegetarian
   products like McVeggie burger and McAloo Tikki. They separated the
   vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections, making sure that this is
   maintained throughout the various stages. To build confidence, they
   even take customers on kitchen tours. Hardcore vegetarians do not enter
   places where non-vegetarian food is served.


   Evidently, McDonald’s India is committed to its customers by developing
   special sauces that only use local spices and chillies. Even the
   mayonnaise and the rest of their sauces are egg-less. McDonald’s wide
   variety of menu includes McAloo Tikki, Spicy Range, Fillet-O- Fish,
   Chicken McGrill, Chicken Mcnuggets, Veg Pizza McPuff, McVeggie, Wraps,
   Fries, an assortment of Sundaes, Soft Serve and refreshing beverages
   such as Ice Tea &amp; Cold. They strengthened the branded affordability
   mantra by introducing the Happy Price Menu which starts at Rs 25 only.


   McDonald’s India classified its products into 2 categories to satisfy
   consumers with different price perceptions. These are:


     * branded affordability (BA) – products include McAloo Tikki and
       Chicken McGrill burgers that cost Rs20-30.
     * branded core value products (BCV) – products include the McVeggie
       and McChicken burgers that cost Rs 50-60


McDonald’s Pricing Strategy


   McDonald’s uses the pricing approach, ‘think global, act local’. They
   have proven to be affluent at using cost leadership pricing strategy by
   offering meals at low prices.


   Prices were kept low by:
     * employing and training employees that are inexperienced instead of
       trained cooks
     * employing a few trained managers only


   They also use price bundling matched with psychological pricing. For
   price bundling, meals and other product bundles are offered for a
   discount. Such as combo meal, family meal, happy meal, and happy price
   menu. The reason is to improve the total sales of the service and
   product. For psychological pricing, they use prices that appear to be
   more affordable, like $__.99 instead of using the whole dollar amount.
   The strategy is to gain customers and make them buy more products.


   Regardless of the standardization being a characteristic of cost
   savings, execution of McDonald’s price strategy is localised rather
   than internationalised.


   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/0gQJXEgCMCg



Each country is subjected to a strict process to determine the price for a
specific market. The process below is the basic structure that McDonald’s
uses to create localised pricing:


     * Selecting the price objective. It depends on its business aims to
       gain market share in cost calculation and global pricing strategy.


     * Determining demand. The determination if the demand for the product
       is significant enough to invest in the venture.


     * Estimating costs. The balance of fixed and/or variable costs vs.
       the expected profits from the business venture.


     * Analysing competitors costs, prices and offers. A local survey,
       business planning and detailed market research conducted. It
       determines if there is still room for another player entering the
       business market.


     * Selecting the pricing method. It includes the list price, the
       discount levels and tactics available to teams, as well as the
       financial options available, etc. The part of the marketing
       strategy that generates revenue. The price must also take into
       consideration the appropriate demand-supply equation.


     * Selecting the final price. The price determined by the pricing team
       that is fair to both the business and the public. For example, the
       team may use value pricing to determine the final invoice price.


   Just like most of the companies’ pricing objectives, McDonald’s also
   aims to increase market share. Its mission statement highlights its
   pricing policy which says:


“Being in touch with the price of our competitors allows us to price our
products correctly, balancing quality and value.”


   For example, in 1996, to penetrate the market in New Delhi, McDonald’s
   set their price by studying a local food chain (Nirula).


   McDonald’s pricing decision involves analysing of demand, competitor
   pricing, costs, a product’s life-cycle and balancing quality with
   value.


   Back in September 2009, McDonald’s reduced its menu prices by almost
   25% specifically for its lunch and dinner. McVeggie and McChicken also
   decreased to Rs. 85 from Rs. 110 and 120 respectively. Lowering prices
   in such times was surprising and did not make sense. However, the
   management in India believed that adjusting its menu prices would help
   customers choose McDonald’s as a lunch and dining destination as well.


McDonald’s India’s Success


   By mid-2000, McDonald’s got its 50% revenue from vegetable food items.
   They proved that they can survive and become successful in a vegetarian
   country. McDonald’s was also emulating a three-pronged strategy:
   increase seating capacity to accommodate more customers; open new
   outlets in Mumbai and Delhi; penetrate new cities.


   In 2003, McDonald’s India became one of McDonald’s top ten operations
   when it comes to average transactions per day in each outlet. Its
   average transactions per day — 1,500.


   The major reasons for McDonald’s India’s success:
    1. System – they had an effective and efficient system in place that
       exploited the minimum wage labour available; they employed young
       teenagers who are just looking to make some money and get basic job
       skills
    2. Convenience – their store is everywhere; found in major shopping
       centres, district, freeway, highway, and at almost every corner
    3. Familiarity – the associations with the Golden Arches, the Big M,
       Ronald McDonald, happiness and fun
    4. Menu – they have the most diverse menus; it targets all ages from
       kids, middle-aged to grandfathers/mothers


   McDonald’s understood the problems and opportunities of the Indian
   market well. It adapted to its products and has been successful since.
   Its success shows in its continuous growth in the fast-food market with
   400 branches all over India.

Implications


     * McDonald’s evolved Indian menus, Indian sensitivities and yet
       remain as globally innovative as ever.


     * At McDonald’s India, the single mantra driving their vision is
       providing 100% total customer satisfaction. The formula to achieve
       this goal is based on the long-standing commitment to the
       McDonald’s Promise.


     * Being in touch with the price of their competitors allows
       McDonald’s India to price the products correctly, balancing quality
       and value.


     * Regardless of the long and established street food tradition in
       India that has also become McDonald’s competitors, McDonald’s did
       not back out but instead doubled its efforts to build its position
       and keep on competing and growing each day. They’ve learned to
       adapt and to cater their menu to people’s local tastes and

Conclusion


     * The fast-food industry in India has evolved with the changing
       lifestyles of the young Indian population. The sheer variety of
       gastronomic preferences across regions – hereditary or acquired –
       has brought about different modules across the country. It may take
       some time for the local enterprise to mature to the level of
       international players in the field.


     * McDonald’s implemented successfully its cost leadership marketing
       strategy, its overall objective is to increase market share.


     * Arriving at a pricing decision is large as a result of analysing
       demand, costs, competitor pricing. They also consider metrics such
       as product’s life-cycle to balance quality with value.


     * Other than the cost of living, certain elements such as
       geographical factors, government regulations, economic climate and
       exchange rate also affect the pricing strategy of McDonald’s in
       India.

Which Indian Street Foods Needs to Go Global?

   Indian Street Foods that Needs to Go Global
   03 Apr
   In: Indian food By: Chef Negi 0 Comment 2755 Views

   Indian street food is popular across the globe for its diversity, spicy
   flavour and amazing taste. Some popular street dishes found in
   different cities of India are Aloo Tikki, Chaat, Pani Puri/Gol Gappe,
   Misal Pav, vada pav Chhole Bhature, Litti chokha and more.

   Besides Indians, many foreign travellers swear by any Indian dish
   that’s easily accessible in the streets of India. Therefore, these
   Indian foods have become popular in different parts of the world.

   You can visit any Indian restaurant in any part of the world to satisfy
   your craving for scrumptious Indian street food that’s likely to
   tantalise your tongue in no time.

What is Indian Street Food?

   Indian street food is often made of a medley of various seasoned
   ingredients, flavourful spices, fresh vegetables, and sweet &amp; sour
   sauces.

   This food variety varies from one region to another. It can incorporate
   dumpling-like recipes like momos or fried dough without or with
   fillings such as chaat papri, samosa, etc.

   You will be amazed to know that a wide range of culinary landscapes of
   different Indian dishes expands throughout Dubai and Bangkok in
   different forms of dosas and Kati rolls to spicy snacks like Aloo Tikki
   or Chaat.

   People in different parts of the world are also building an appetite
   for these foods. That’s why it’s not difficult to find a good Indian
   restaurant offering traditional Indian street food in various parts of
   the world.

   There are a homely feel and comfort factor in every Indian food. That’s
   the reason why this has become a commonplace food in India and
   intrigues so many people due to different cuisine options for different
   types of food lovers.

Is Indian Street Food Healthy?

   A mere mention of Indian street food can easily make mouths water just
   on hearing its name. However, many people still stay away from street
   food, as it falls into the category of junk food.

   However, the truth is that if you go to any good Indian restaurant, you
   get a variety of dishes to choose from. Many street food varieties are
   indeed devoid of significant health benefits and essential nutrients.

   But some Indian street food dishes may not necessarily include in the
   list of foods to avoid. Moreover, a wide selection of this food variety
   is quite healthy. This is because Indian street food variety available
   in restaurants is prepared with fresh ingredients and different spices
   that are known to be beneficial for health.

   We won’t say that Indian street food is healthy. But if prepared with
   freshly cooked vegetables and other health-benefiting spices in a
   sanitized restaurant kitchen, it can be quite a safe and healthy option
   to eat with your family and friends.

10 Indian Street Foods that need to go global

   While you can choose from a wide variety of Indian street foods, some
   dishes are so delicious that you cannot miss tasting them. Here is a
   list of the popular street food that must go global:

1. Aloo Tikki

   Aloo Tikki

   Aloo Tikki is the South Asian variety of potato croquette. It is made
   of mashed boiled potatoes that are mixed with onions, coriander and
   spices. After that, these are shaped in round patties.

   These round patties are further deep-fried to form a crispy exterior
   that’s still soft enough to melt in the mouth. The spicy potato cutlets
   are served with tamarind and mint chutney, tomato ketchup or yoghurt
   sauce and hence, a perfect South Asian staple.

2. Bhelpuri

   Bhelpuri

   Bhelpuri is a blast of different flavours in your mouth. It is a West
   Indian street food item that combines salty, sweet and spicy flavours
   in the form of one delicious snack. It is also a vegan dish and
   traditionally served in a simple paper cone.

   Recently, it’s also being served as a common appetizer in dinner
   parties, as it is easy to make. For preparing bhelpuri, pre-prepared
   ingredients are tossed into a large bowl, mixed with chutneys and
   viola!

   All the ingredients contain sev (fried noodles made of chickpea flour
   and puff rice), diced onions, chaat masala and green chillies. Finally,
   cilantro is added as a garnish to make the dish presentable.

3. Chaat

   Chaat

   It is another common Indian street food that’s mostly found in
   different regions of North India. However, chaat is a term used
   generally for South Asian street food. Many people in the world are
   fond of Indian Chaat.

   Chaat includes papri that’s further layers with boiled potatoes, boiled
   chickpeas or maybe bean sprouts. It is further layered with seasoned
   yoghurt sauce.

   According to different types of chaat varieties, its components can
   also be added to samosa or Aloo Tikki. Finally, the dish is served with
   sev and tamarind chutney.

   The different kinds of Chaat available in different Indian restaurants
   across the world are Peas and Aloo Chaat, Idli Chaat, Sprouts Chaat,
   Oats Chaat, Raw Mango Chaat, Cutlet Chaat, Palak Chaat, Boondi Chaat,
   Cutlet Chaat, etc. Not only that but there are also over 500 varieties
   of Chaat that must be available globally, as these are quite healthy
   alternatives to other junk food.

4. Dosa

   Dosa

   Dosa is a perfect crepe, which is made from a fermented batter of black
   lentils and rice. Although it is a major South Indian cuisine savoury,
   Dosa is commonly found in various food stalls in different parts of
   India.

   Dosa is made of stuffed or plain crepe. The stuffed dosa is usually
   filled with mashed potatoes, onions and other ingredients. Depending on
   the type of dosa, it can also be stuffed with paneer, mutton or other
   food items. Some Indian families also serve dosa with shredded cheese
   that tastes amazing.

   The most common chutneys served with dosa are green chutney and coconut
   chutney. Even sambar is served with dosa. Milagai podi (also called
   gunpowder) mixed with gingelly oil is another commonly found dosa
   condiment for dosa purists.

5. Kati Roll

   Kati Roll

   Have you ever tried Kati roll? If not, you must try this tasty Indian
   dish in the lunch hour to fill your heart and stomach. Besides lunch
   hour, it can be enjoyed as a filling breakfast or evening snacks if
   you’re too hungry.

   No matter whenever you prefer to have it, Kati roll is likely to become
   one of your favourite Indian food items as soon as you taste
   it. Although Kati Rolls are considered West Bengal’s burrito, they are
   a closer relative of Frankie or shawarma (if you’ve tasted these
   dishes, you’d get an idea).

   The unique flavour of the Kati roll is distinctive. It’s roti exterior
   envelopes soft spiced paneer, lamb or chicken, in addition to some
   tasty toppings that vary from mixed cooked/raw vegetables to scrambled
   eggs. Finally, it’s garnished with different types of spicy sauces, a
   sprinkle of chaat masala and some lemon or lime squeeze.

6. Kebab

   Kebab

   Kebab is a South Asian dish that includes different types of vegetables
   or marinated pieces of fish or meat (grilled or roasted) for evoking
   charred flavour.  Indian-style kebabs taste out of this world and are
   worth your time and money, as they guarantee to please your taste buds
   as soon as you take a bite.

   According to the type of restaurant you visit, Indian-style kebabs are
   prepared in different types of spice blends that vary from spicy and
   sweet to sour flavours. Usually, the murgh malai (which is a Hindi
   translation of “tangy chicken”) is the less spicy flavour of kebab. The
   most famous kebabs that many people around the world love are chicken
   tikka and Tangri chicken.

   But if you find tandoori chicken or chicken tikka too mainstream, you
   may think of taking your kebab game to another level by ordering it in
   different flavours like seekh, hariyali, reshmi and shami kebabs. These
   are some of the best kebab varieties to enjoy the flavours of the
   Indo-kebab world.

7. Kulfi

   Kulfi

   Kulfi is known to be an Indian version of ice cream. However, there are
   many differences between ice cream and kulfi. The major difference lies
   in its texture and flavour.

   Usually, kulfi in Indian streets is served in the classic mould with a
   unique topping for creating kulfi falooda. Falooda is a type of ice
   cream float that’s prepared with rose syrup base, basil seeds and
   vermicelli noodles. Besides, there are many other varieties of kulfis
   like mango kulfi, badam kulfi, malai kulfi and more.

8. Pani Puri

   Pani Puri

   Pani puri is also known as gol gappa, gup chup and puchka in different
   parts of India. It is the most popular Indian street food, which not
   only Indians love but many foreigners as well.

   This dish consists of small puri shells that are made from unleavened
   dough, bread pieces and semolina mixture. These are hollowed out and
   generally stuffed with a mixture of potatoes and smashed chickpeas or
   bean sprouts (which are added very occasionally)

   These stuffed puri shells are further garnished with some different
   toppings like mint chutney, tamarind chutney, diced onions and green
   chilies. Finally, spicy “pani” (water) is added, which is usually
   flavoured with chaat masala and tamarind paste.

   You can easily find pani puri in any good Indian restaurant in
   different regions of the world. But after enjoying the crispy pani
   puris, don’t forget to enjoy leftover pani as a cocktail.

9. Pakora

   Pakora

   It is one of the easiest street foods for replicating at home. Pakora
   fritter is usually made by dipping different types of vegetable pieces
   in chickpea flour-based batter. It is further deep-fried until turned
   golden brown.

   The fried pakora is served with different types of sauces, such as mint
   chutney, tomato ketchup or tamarind chutney, depending on your
   preference.

   Some of the most common vegetables used to make pakora are eggplant,
   onions, cauliflower and green chilli peppers. Besides vegetable pakora,
   chicken and fish pakoras are also available for non-vegetarians.

10. Pav Bhaji

   Pav Bhaji

   Pav Bhai has originated from the Indian state Maharashtra. It is a
   blend of vegetables that are cooked on a flat griddle with tomato-based
   gravy. The entire dish is served with a buttered bread roll.

   This Indian dish seems to be a version of Sloppy Joe but Indian
   vegetarian-style. Even non-vegetarian style versions of pav bhaji are
   made with curried ground meat (or kheema). This type of pav bhaji is
   known as kheema pav.

Conclusion

   One of the best things about Indian street food is that it’s easily
   accessible in almost any region in India. With the popularity of Indian
   restaurants in the world, people living in foreign lands can also enjoy
   the taste of different flavourful and spicy Indian street food dishes.

   The reason why Indian street food must become popular across the globe
   is that it’s delicious, which is quite evident from the rush of crowds
   gathering to eat any Indian dish. Furthermore, Indian street food is
   affordable and hence, ideal for those travellers who are on a budget.

Fast food

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to navigation Jump to search
   Food prepared and served in a small amount of time
   For other uses, see Fast food (disambiguation).
   See also: Processed food
   This article's lead section may be too long for the length of the
   article. Please help by moving some material from it into the body of
   the article. Please read the layout guide and lead section guidelines
   to ensure the section will still be inclusive of all essential details.
   Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. (November 2021)

   Examples of fast food (left to right, top to bottom): Cheeseburger,
   soft drink, french fries, pizza margherita, hot dog, fried chicken,
   submarine sandwich, and donuts.

   Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial
   resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a
   commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with
   frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for
   take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to
   accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
   workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570
   billion globally.^[1]

   The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which
   reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
   primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
   pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef
   patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and
   cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".

   Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the
   drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no
   shelter or seating,^[2] or fast food restaurants (also known as quick
   service restaurants).^[3] Franchise operations that are part of
   restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each
   restaurant from central locations.^[4]

   Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and
   calories.^[5] Fast food has been linked to increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol,
   insulin resistance conditions and depression.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding
   lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast food
   consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.^[11]

History

   Pulling wheat dough into thin strands to form lamian
   See also: Fast food restaurant § History

   The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with
   urban developments. Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate
   space or proper food preparation accoutrements. Additionally, procuring
   cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in
   vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive. Homeowners
   feared that a rogue cooking fire "might easily conflagrate an entire
   neighborhood".^[12] Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase
   pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever
   possible. This also ensured that customers with strictly limited time
   (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family,
   for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not
   inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as
   is expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant). In Ancient Rome,
   cities had street stands – a large counter with a receptacle in the
   middle from which food or drink would have been served.^[13] It was
   during post-WWII American economic boom that Americans began to spend
   more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism
   bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with
   the strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the
   household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had
   previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence, and
   then a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service
   and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family
   dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway
   fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is
   getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47
   minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes
   per day in 2013.^[14]

Pre-industrial Old World

   In the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population living
   in insulae, multi-story apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for
   much of their meal; the Forum itself served as a marketplace where
   Romans could purchase baked goods and cured meats.^[15] In the
   mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack and cooked
   vegetables and stews later in popina, a simple type of eating
   establishment.^[16] In Asia, 12th century Chinese ate fried dough,
   soups and stuffed buns, all of which still exist as contemporary snack
   food.^[17] Their Baghdadi contemporaries supplemented home-cooked meals
   with processed legumes, purchased starches, and even ready-to-eat
   meats.^[18] During the Middle Ages, large towns and major urban areas
   such as London and Paris supported numerous vendors that sold dishes
   such as pies, pasties, flans, waffles, wafers, pancakes and cooked
   meats. As in Roman cities during antiquity, many of these
   establishments catered to those who did not have means to cook their
   own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers,
   many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus
   relied on fast food. Travelers such as pilgrims en route to a holy
   site, were among the customers.^[19]

   Blue plaque in Oldham, England commemorating the 1860s origins of fish
   and chips and the fast food industry

   In areas with access to coastal or tidal waters, 'fast food' frequently
   included local shellfish or seafood, such as oysters or, as in London,
   eels. Often this seafood was cooked directly on the quay or close
   by.^[20] The development of trawler fishing in the mid-nineteenth
   century led to the development of a British favourite, fish and chips,
   and the first shop in 1860.^[21]
   Fish and chips in a wrapper

   A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the
   fish and chip shop and fast food industries.^[21] As a cheap fast food
   served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the
   Victorian working classes.^[21] By 1910, there were more than 25,000
   fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more
   than 35,000 shops.^[22] Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain
   opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in
   1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish
   and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.^[23]

   British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the
   regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective
   area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of
   fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl
   commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used
   more frequently in fast food.^[24] The UK has adopted fast food from
   other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More
   recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also
   emerged.

   As automobiles became popular and more affordable following World War
   I, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The American company White
   Castle, founded by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in Wichita, Kansas
   in 1921, is generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet
   and first hamburger chain, selling hamburgers for five cents each.^[25]
   Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita
   in 1916, introducing the limited menu, high-volume, low-cost,
   high-speed hamburger restaurant.^[26] Among its innovations, the
   company allowed customers to see the food being prepared. White Castle
   was successful from its inception and spawned numerous competitors.

   Franchising was introduced in 1921 by A&amp;W Root Beer, which franchised
   its distinctive syrup. Howard Johnson's first franchised the restaurant
   concept in the mid-1930s, formally standardizing menus, signage and
   advertising.^[26]

   Curb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in the
   1940s when carhops strapped on roller skates.^[27]

   The United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and
   American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries.
   Approximately 5.4 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of
   food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the US as
   of 2018.^[28] Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses
   have inspired many local government officials in the United States to
   propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are
   unwilling to change their fast food consumption even in the face of
   rising costs and unemployment characterized by the great recession,
   suggesting an inelastic demand.^[29] However, some areas are more
   affected than others. In Los Angeles County, for example, about 45% of
   the restaurants in South Central Los Angeles are fast-food chains or
   restaurants with minimal seating. By comparison, only 16% of those on
   the Westside are such restaurants.^[30]

Working conditions

   The National Employment Law Project wrote in 2013, "according to a
   study by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley, more
   than half (52 percent) of front-line fast-food workers must rely on at
   least one public assistance program to support their families. As a
   result, the fast-food-industry business model of low wages,
   non-existent benefits, and limited work hours costs taxpayers an
   average of nearly $7 billion every year". They claim this funding
   allows these workers to "afford health care, food, and other basic
   necessities".^[31]^[32]

On the go

   See also: Convenience food

   McDonald's first two-lane drive-thru was at the Rock N Roll McDonald's
   in Chicago.

   Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers that promise
   quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a "drive-through"
   service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles.
   Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat
   on-site. The boom in IT services has allowed customers to order food
   from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

   Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on
   the go," often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a
   finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and
   chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries,
   onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream,
   though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like chili,
   mashed potatoes, and salads.

  Filling stations

   Convenience stores located within many petrol/gas stations sell
   pre-packaged sandwiches, doughnuts, and hot food. Many gas stations in
   the United States and Europe also sell frozen foods, and have microwave
   ovens on the premises in which to prepare them. Petrol Stations in
   Australia sell foods such as hot pies, sandwiches, and chocolate bars,
   which are easy for a customer to access while on their journey. Petrol
   stations are a place that are often open long hours and are open before
   and after shop trading hours, therefore, it makes it easy to access for
   consumers.

  Street vendors and concessions

   Main article: Street food

   Street vendor serving fast food in Nepal

   Fastfood restaurant in Eastern Europe: The Pajdaš (in Prekmurje dialect
   Buddy), Murska Sobota Slovenia.

   Traditional street food is available around the world, usually through
   small and independent vendors operating from a cart, table, portable
   grill or motor vehicle. Common examples include Vietnamese rice soup
   vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands, New York City hot dog carts,
   and taco trucks. Turo-Turo vendors (Tagalog for point point) are a
   feature of Philippine life. Commonly, street vendors provide a colorful
   and varying range of options designed to captivate passers-by and
   attract as much attention as possible quickly.

   Multiple street vendors may specialize in specific types of food;
   typically, they are characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic
   tradition depending on the locale. In some cultures, it is typical for
   street vendors to call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play
   music, or engage in other forms of "street theatrics" to engage
   prospective customers. In some cases, this can garner more attention
   than the food.^[citation needed]

Cuisine

   Fastfood in Ilorin, Kwara

   Modern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared in
   an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients
   and standardized cooking and production methods.^[33] It is usually
   rapidly served in cartons or bags or in plastic wrapping, in a fashion
   that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are
   generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply
   facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are
   reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying) or assembled in
   a short amount of time. This process ensures a consistent level of
   product quality. It is key to being able to deliver the order quickly
   to the customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the
   individual stores.

   Because of commercial emphasis on quickness, uniformity and low cost,
   fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to
   achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve freshness.

  Variants

   Many types of sushi ready to eat

   Chinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular in
   Western countries such as the US and UK. They normally offer a wide
   variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has normally been
   fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice, or meat. In some
   cases, the food is presented as a smörgåsbord, sometimes self service.
   The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and
   then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to
   combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by
   weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may
   offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount.

   Lamb shish kebab

   Sushi has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world.
   A form of fast food created in Japan (where bentō is the Japanese
   variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with
   a sweet rice vinegar and served with some topping (often fish), or, as
   in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in nori (dried laver) with
   filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or cucumber.

   Pizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with
   nationwide chains including Papa John's, Domino's Pizza, Sbarro and
   Pizza Hut. It trails only the burger industry in supplying children's
   fast food calories.^[34] Menus are more limited and standardized than
   in traditional pizzerias, and pizza delivery is offered.

   Kebab houses are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East,
   especially Turkey and Lebanon. Meat is shaven from a rotisserie, and is
   served on a warmed flatbread with salad and a choice of sauce and
   dressing. These doner kebabs or shawarmas are distinct from shish
   kebabs served on sticks. Kebab shops are also found throughout the
   world, especially Europe, New Zealand and Australia but they generally
   are less common in the US.

   Fish and chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United
   Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Fish is battered and then deep
   fried, and served with deep-fried potato strips.^[35]

   A box of five chicken wings, served at a Hesburger fast food restaurant
   in Helsinki, Finland

   The Dutch have their own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal
   often consists of a portion of french fries (called friet or patat)
   with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany
   french fries is fritessaus. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat
   mayonnaise substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call
   "mayonnaise". When ordering it is very often abbreviated to met
   (literally "with"). Other popular sauces are ketchup or spiced ketchup
   ("curry"), Indonesian style peanut sauce ("satésaus" or "pindasaus") or
   piccalilli. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces,
   most famously speciaal (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and
   chopped onions; and oorlog (literally "war"): mayonnaise and peanut
   sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat
   product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a
   deep fried skinless minced meat sausage), and the kroket (deep fried
   meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs).

   Fast-food place in Portugal

   A small restaurant with pasztecik szczeciński in Szczecin, Poland

   In Portugal, there are some varieties of local fast-food and
   restaurants specialized in this type of local cuisine. Some of the most
   popular foods include frango assado (Piri-piri grilled chicken
   previously marinated), francesinha, francesinha poveira, espetada
   (turkey or pork meat on two sticks) and bifanas (pork cutlets in a
   specific sauce served as a sandwich). This type of food is also often
   served with french fries (called batatas fritas), some international
   chains started appearing specialized in some of the typical Portuguese
   fast food such as Nando's.

   An example of a local form of fast food in Poland is pasztecik
   szczeciński, a deep-fried yeast dough stuffed with meat or vegetarian
   filling, typical fast food dish of the city of Szczecin well known in
   many other cities in the country. A dish is on Polish List of
   traditional products. The first bar serving pasztecik szczeciński, Bar
   "Pasztecik" founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46
   in Szczecin.

   A fixture of East Asian cities is the noodle shop. Flatbread and
   falafel are today ubiquitous in the Middle East. Popular Indian fast
   food dishes include vada pav, panipuri and dahi vada. In the
   French-speaking nations of West Africa, roadside stands in and around
   the larger cities continue to sell—as they have done for generations—a
   range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled meat sticks known locally as
   brochettes (not to be confused with the bread snack of the same name
   found in Europe)

Business

   In the United States, consumers spent $160 billion on fast food in 2012
   (up from $6 billion in 1970).^[36]^[37] In 2013, the US restaurant
   industry had total projected sales of $660.5 billion.^[38] Fast food
   has been losing market share to fast casual dining restaurants, which
   offer more robust and expensive cuisines.^[39] Due to this competition,
   fast food giants have seen dramatic drops in their sales.^[40] While
   overall fast food sales have fallen, the number of Americans who eat in
   these restaurants "once a month or 'a few times a year'" has
   risen.^[40]

   In contrast to the rest of the world, American citizens spend a much
   smaller amount of their income on food — largely due to various
   government subsidies that make fast food cheap and easily
   accessible.^[41] Calorie for calorie, foods sold in fast food
   restaurants, costs less and is more energy-dense, and is made mostly of
   products that the government subsidizes heavily: corn, soy, and
   beef.^[42]

   The Australian fast food market is valued at more than 2.7 billion GPB
   and is composed of 1.4 billion fast food meals. This includes meals
   serviced at 17,000 fast food outlets. The fast food market has
   experienced an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent, which is the
   most rapidly growing sector of the retail food market.^[43]

   In 2012, fast food restaurants spent roughly US$4.6 billion on
   advertising campaigns, which represented an 8% increase from 2009. In
   the same period of time, McDonald's spent nearly three times as much on
   advertising as all water, milk, and produce advertisers spent
   combined.^[44]

   A study done by researchers from the Geisel School of Medicine at
   Dartmouth College saw results that suggest that when children watch
   more commercial television (and see more advertisements on fast food),
   they are more inclined to ask to visit these subsequent fast food
   restaurants.^[45] Specifically, fast food restaurants have been
   increasing their advertising efforts that target Black and Hispanic
   youth.^[46] A 2021 report from the Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp;
   Obesity indicated that fast-food restaurants spent about $318 million
   on Spanish-language TV channels. The same report found that fast-food
   restaurants spent about $99 million on majority Black viewer TV
   channels. Black youth groups viewed fast-food advertisements about more
   than white youth groups.^[47]

   The Council of Better Business Bureaus started the Children's Food and
   Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2006 which asked fast food companies
   to pledge to "advertise only more healthful products to children" with
   McDonald's and Burger King signing on.^[45] However, despite a slight
   increase in healthful food advertising, the effectiveness of this
   initiative has been disputed by studies that reveal that "children
   couldn't remember or identify healthful foods in the ads, and that 81
   percent of the 99 3 to 7 year olds in that study recalled French fries"
   even though there were no french fries in the advertisement.^[48]

Employment

   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 4.1 million
   U.S. workers are employed in food preparation and serving (including
   fast food) as of 2010.^[28] The BLS's projected job outlook expects
   average growth and excellent opportunity as a result of high turnover.
   However, in April 2011, McDonald's hired approximately 62,000 new
   workers and received a million applications for those positions—an
   acceptance rate of 6.2%.^[49] The median age of workers in the industry
   in 2013 was 28.^[50] Obtaining Human Resource Management diploma or
   diploma in Fast Food Management can help to get a job in major fast
   food restaurants since it is one of the most desired.^[51]

Globalization

   McDonald's in Russia

   McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut fast food restaurants
   in the United Arab Emirates

   In 2006, the global fast-food market grew by 4.8% and reached a value
   of £102.4 billion and a volume of 80.3 billion transactions.^[52]
   McDonald's alone, has outlets in 126 countries on 6 continents and
   operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide.^[53]

   One example of McDonald's expansion on a global scale was its
   introduction to the Russian market. In order for the American business
   to succeed it would have to be accepted and integrated into the daily
   lives of natives in Moscow. Thus, the restaurant was strategically
   implemented so that its offerings would align with the distinct and
   established eating habits, also known as the customs around food,
   eating and cooking, of Muscovites. One significant characteristic of
   Russian food culture is the emphasis on knowing about the locality of
   goods that are consumed. Essentially, in order to successfully launch
   this American brand in a foreign country, McDonald's interpreted the
   local interests of consumers in Moscow by promoting the origins of the
   produce used in the restaurant.^[54] On January 31, 1990, McDonald's
   opened a restaurant in Moscow and broke opening-day records for
   customers served. The Moscow restaurant is the busiest in the world.

   The largest McDonald's in the world, with 25,000 feet of play tubes, an
   arcade and play center, is located in Orlando, Florida, United
   States^[55]^[clarification needed]

   There are numerous other fast food restaurants located all over the
   world. Burger King has more than 11,100 restaurants in more than 65
   countries.^[56] KFC is located in 25 countries.^[57] Subway is one of
   the fastest growing franchises in the world with approximately 39,129
   restaurants in 90 countries as of May 2009,^[58] the first non-US
   location opening in December 1984 in Bahrain.^[59] Wienerwald has
   spread from Germany into Asia^[60] and Africa.^[61] Pizza Hut is
   located in 97 countries, with 100 locations in China.^[62] Taco Bell
   has 278 restaurants located in 14 countries besides the United
   States.^[63]

Criticism

   Main article: Criticism of fast food

   Further information: Fast food worker strikes

   Fast-food chains have come under criticism over concerns ranging from
   claimed negative health effects, alleged animal cruelty, cases of
   worker exploitation, and claims of cultural degradation via shifts in
   people's eating patterns away from traditional
   foods.^[64]^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]^[71]^[72]^[73]^[74]^[75]^[76]
   ^[77]

   The intake of fast food is increasing worldwide. A study done in the
   city of Jeddah has shown that current fast-food habits are related to
   the increase of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Saudi
   Arabia.^[78] In 2014, the World Health Organization published a study
   which claims that deregulated food markets are largely to blame for the
   obesity crisis, and suggested tighter regulations to reverse the
   trend.^[79] In the United States, local governments are restricting
   fast food chains by limiting the number of restaurants found in certain
   geographical areas.^[80]

   To combat criticism, fast-food restaurants are starting to offer more
   health-friendly menu items.^[81] In addition to health critics, there
   are suggestions for the fast-food industry to become more eco-friendly.
   The chains have responded by "reducing packaging waste".^[81]

   Although trying to overcome criticism through healthy options on fast
   food menus, Marion Nestle, who serves as the chair of New York
   University's Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, suggests that
   fast-food industries intentionally market unhealthy foods to children
   through advertising options and therefore create customers for
   life.^[82]

   Despite so much popularity, fast foods and fast-food chains have
   adverse impacts not only on the job and social skills, but on the
   health and academic performance of students. Fifty-six percent of
   students consume fast food on a weekly basis.^[83] The researcher who
   wrote Fast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser, highlights this fact, arguing
   that this is not only a financial but also a psychological bait, in
   that the students are lured towards this early employment opportunity
   knowing little that the time spent on this no-skill-learning job is
   wasted.^[84] Two other researchers, Charles Hirschman and Irina
   Voloshin, highlight their dangerous impacts and consequences regarding
   the hiring and firing of teenage school-goers in the fast-food
   industry.^[85] Kelly Brownwell of The Atlantic Times has further
   supported this argument that Burger King and McDonald's adopted another
   dangerous practice for marketing to innocent children.^[86]

   In a research study conducted by Professors Purtell Kelly and Gershoff,
   they found that the students of fifth grades, who ate fast foods as
   compared to the students of the same age after some other social
   factors were controlled.^[clarification needed] Also, the percentage of
   the students having consumed fast food and showed poor grades was
   around 11 percent more than those who used organic foods. They are of
   the view that other social factors such as television watching, video
   games and playing were controlled to assess the real impacts of fast
   foods.^[87]

   There have been books and films, such as the 2004 film Super Size Me,
   designed to highlight the potential negative health effects from the
   overconsumption of fast food such as its contribution to obesity.^[88]

Basic Differences Between Indian Street Food &amp; Fast Food

   Take a walk down a busy street and you’ll notice that it is full of
   options available to eat. Some outlets have proper dining space, while
   others may just be stand-alone vendors. This scene is the same
   worldwide. Whether it’s the eastern end of the planet or the western.
   Our society has grown around several types of edibles. We were never
   confined to the limits of our kitchen.

   The journey of buying cooked food for consumption began centuries ago
   and today, it is a normal practice. Well, we are here to discuss two
   types of bites available in the market. Street food and fast food. More
   specifically Indian street food and fast food because this blog is for
   everyone who thinks they are one and the same thing! No. There are many
   facets between them.

   Let me introduce the brand a bit first. EggHolic, an Indian restaurant
   in Brampton, CA, is a well-established Indian food chain. It began its
   journey in the US with a small location and today has several branches
   across America. It has just opened up in Canada and will soon be taking
   over the great white north as well. If you wish to join the success
   run, do leave your details on the franchise page on the website.

   Coming back to our topic, the fundamental difference between street
   food and fast food is the way one prepares it. Fast food is anything
   that’s made by bringing pre-cooked condiments together to make the
   final item. Whereas, street food is anything that’s cooked on the spot
   with raw ingredients. Read on to learn more about both of these food
   types.

Top 3 Differences Between Street Food &amp; Fast Food

   Many believe that Street Food is the same as Fast Food. Well, you can
   say that because both of these edibles are made and served within
   moments. But they are poles apart, and here’s how.

   1) Composition

   Fast food has high quantities of refined sugar, complex fat, and
   carbohydrates. The combination of all this, though pleasing, can cause
   grave complications in the future. On the other hand, street food, more
   specifically, Indian street food, contains fresh veggies, beneficial
   spices, and the least amount of processed products. It is the ideal
   quick bite for people watching their weight.

   We are living in times where having a healthy immune system is of
   utmost importance. Fast food does provide momentary satisfaction, but
   street food provides contentment with medical perks. In the case of
   EggHolic, the menu is curated keeping all necessary parameters in mind.
   Every platter, be it egg, paneer, or chicken-based offers great taste.

   2) Health Effects

   Adding on to the above-mentioned words, Indian cuisine is inherently
   healthy. The culture and traditions of this nation have always revolved
   around the benefit of mankind.

   We, at EggHolic, have not only brought the famous Gujarati Egg-Culture
   to the US but also its inanimate experience. Every customer who buys
   food from our brand has always appreciated its freshness and the
   patience that goes into preparing these healthful delights! Do you know
   that an egg has nutrients such as high-quality protein, iron, vitamins,
   minerals, and carotenoids? It is also a powerhouse of ailment-fighting
   components like lutein and zeaxanthin.

   We have all heard the phrase, “Health is Wealth”. Well, I guess this is
   the reason behind the rapid growth of the EggHolic brand across
   northwestern America.

   The triumphant journey has reached Canada from the US, and we expect it
   to perform similarly because our motto is to deliver moments worth
   sharing. We ensure that all our platters are cooked with the best
   ingredients and provide long-lasting advantages to all consumers.

   3) The Diversity Factor

   Finally, the range of platters available in the Street Food section is
   vastly more than the Fast Food section. Be it the US or Canada, busy
   roads are full of vendors offering the same type of edibles with a few
   twists. The bread, butter, and cheese with something to complement. But
   street food, again, Indian street food has varieties that will leave
   you surprised.

   India is known for its “university in diversity”, and so is visible in
   its street food options. The EggHolic Menu has platters from all parts
   of the country and we are adding more to the group as time passes.
   There’s no end to it! There is a perception of street food as a place
   where new foods can be explored with an authentic and homemade feel.
   Check out our menu to see all you can have at the Indian restaurant in
   Brampton, Canada. Here are a few best-sellers.

Fast Food Culture and Industrialization

   Meena Chetty

   On my latest visit to India this past summer, I noticed at least one
   McDonald’s in every city, a Kentucky Fried Chicken at the airport, and
   most recently, the appearance of Starbucks franchises throughout the
   country. According to Euromonitor International, a compiler of consumer
   food service statistics, there were 339 McDonald’s outlets alone in
   2013 with an expected 150 new McCafé outlets in the years to
   come.<lt;sup>gt;1<lt;/sup>gt; Furthermore, throughout my trip, I noticed that many
   packaged foods in India do not provide nutritional information, unlike
   what is required of all products in the U.S.

   Because of weaker food and drug regulations, along with the expansion
   of the fast food industry, India’s population of obese individuals is
   increasing. India is the third most obese country in the world, with
   more than 3% of its population facing obesity according to Obesity
   Foundation India.<lt;sup>gt;2<lt;/sup>gt;  This trend is prevalent in multiple
   newly industrialized nations, including Pakistan, South Africa, and
   China. While the rise of the Indian fast food industry is a sign of
   economic growth, it comes with the cost of rising obesity due to the
   lack of adequate health emphasis and education in India.

   Globalization plays a significant role in India’s growth in obesity. Of
   the top ten most popular tourist destinations in India, five are also
   on the list of the country’s most obese regions. The areas on both
   these lists see some of the greatest economic advancement due to
   urbanization.<lt;sup>gt;3<lt;/sup>gt;  Because of the country’s decreasing age
   profile and growing middle class income, a more experimental nature and
   interest in the “foreign” is prevalent in cities. As a result, interest
   in American fast food is peaking. In the past year, Burger King
   partnered with Everstone, a major Indian real-estate company, to expand
   the number of outlets throughout the country.<lt;sup>gt;4<lt;/sup>gt;

   The foreign fast food influence in India is a direct contributor of
   increasing health issues as a result of the country’s historically weak
   emphasis on health maintenance. Until recently, public health education
   in India was only available through medical school, reflecting the
   inherent lack of focus on health studies for the public.<lt;sup>gt;5<lt;/sup>gt;
   Verifying the state of physical fitness in India, a 2012 study
   conducted by the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism found
   that 59.3 percent of women and 58.5 percent of men lead sedentary
   lifestyles, verifying the poor state of physical fitness in India.
   Inactive lifestyles coupled with limited health studies compared to
   other countries create a weak foundation to counter fast food
   culture.<lt;sup>gt;6<lt;/sup>gt;

   The countering prevalence of malnutrition in India makes matters more
   complicated. The International Food Policy Research Institute has a
   branch called Partnerships and Opportunities to Strengthen and
   Harmonize Actions for Nutrition in India (POSHAN) that hosts an annual
   Together for Nutrition conference focusing on food based health
   tactics. However, one in three of the world’s malnourished children are
   from India; as a result, most of POSHAN’s work is centered on
   alleviating starvation and improving food access for mothers and
   children. Consequently, the organizations that would normally dedicate
   time and resources to promote physical activity are instead focused on
   eliminating malnutrition.<lt;sup>gt;7<lt;/sup>gt;

   Because the fast food industry is largely based in America, the
   globalization of our franchises is our responsibility. The fact that
   these companies are contributing significantly to worsening health
   conditions in foreign countries with limited access to health awareness
   should be a trigger for the U.S. to become involved and counteract the
   negative influence that our businesses are having on international
   obesity by helping improve the health emphasis in countries that do not
   have adequate resources to independently do so. The next time I visit
   India, I hope to have access to the nutritional information of the food
   I eat.

   Consumer Preferences towards Western Origin Fast Foods in Urban India
   (Chandigarh City)

   INTRODUCTION AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
   1.1 Introduction:
   India is the world’s second largest producer of food next to China, and
   has the potential of being the biggest with the food and agricultural
   sector. The total food production in India is likely to double in the
   next ten years and there is an opportunity for large investments in
   food and food processing technologies, skills and equipment, especially
   in areas health food. Health food supplement is another rapidly rising
   segment of this industry that is gaining vast popularity amongst the
   health conscious.

   The revival of the tourism industry in 2003 resulted in a positive
   spillover effect into the consumer food service market^1 . India is one
   of the world’s major food producers but accounts for less than 1.5 per
   cent of international food trade. This indicates vast scope for both
   investors and exporters. The Indian food industries sales turnover is
   Rs.140,000 crore (1crore = 10 million) annually as at the start of year
   2000. The industry has the highest number of plants approved by the US
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outside the USA.

   The most promising sub-sectors include -Soft-drink bottling,
   Confectionery manufacture, Fishing, Aquaculture, Grain-milling and
   Grain-based products, Meat and poultry processing, Alcoholic beverages,
   Milk processing, Tomato paste, Fast food, Ready-to-eat breakfast
   cereals, Food additives, flavors etc^2

   The liberalization of the Indian economy and its resulting effects on
   consumer habits is leading to a higher incidence of eating out among
   the majority of consumers. This emerging trend is especially prevalent
   among middle class Indians, as dining out is increasingly perceived as
   a form of entertainment.

   Constant value sales within the FSR sector are registering a slight
   increase of 7% over the previous year. Major value shares in the market
   are largely held by Indian Multi-cuisine and south Indian restaurants,
   which dominate with an 84% share of total FSR value sales in 2003.
   Independent operators hold more than an almost 90% value share of the
   Fast food sector in India, offering a variety of menus catering to
   local tastes. Therefore, value shares held by Fast food sub sectors
   such as burger and chicken are comparatively low, and penetration is
   still limited.

   The euromonitor forecasts an overall positive performance over the
   forecast period, with a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 11.3% in
   terms of units, and forecast growth of 82.4% and 57.2% for transactions
   and constant value sales respectively. During the forecast period, fast
   food units will experience nearly 60% growth over 2003^3 .

   The sizable Indian market has prompted many MNCs to set up shops in
   India. The few who have succeeded had come to understand that the
   Indian market is different due to its cultural diversity. Gaining local
   acceptance and blending in to the Indian culture still remains a
   challenge for many fast food restaurants. Most multinational-chained
   food service companies adopted the franchising route to set up
   operations and expanded their market presence, as opposed to direct
   investment or entering into joint ventures.

   Most international brands, such as Pizza Hut and McDonald’s, have
   revised their Western menus to suit the Indian pallet. This, along with
   aggressive marketing strategies such as offering discount coupons, has
   significantly boosted their business and increased sales.

   Every company has to adopt the principles of marketing for creating,
   promoting, pricing and delivering goods. Marketing managers are the key
   to creating product awareness, stimulating demand and meeting the
   objectives of the organization.

   1.2 Statement of Problem:
   Today’s consumer is empowered to choose between many vendors when
   considering a purchase. This is especially true where the market is
   limited and competitors fight fiercely for market share.

   In order to design effective product, promotion, pricing and
   distribution strategies, food marketers need to understand the
   attitudes, perceptions, experiences and behaviors of their consumers.
   However, currently there is limited information available about the
   food consumption behavior in urban India. Most of the people,
   especially the younger generation from villages migrate in lakhs, every
   year, towards towns in search of good jobs and better living. Unlike,
   western countries, in India predicting about the buying behavior of
   consumer’s remains a difficult task, especially because of the
   urban-rural divide and the constant migration of population from
   villages towards towns. Indian consumers typically maintain their
   distinct food habits even after migrating to different parts of the
   country.

   The researcher wishes to study, how consumers in Chandigarh perceive
   and utilize Western fast food offerings. Chandigarh is a Union
   Territory and the capital city of two states in North India (Punjab and
   Haryana).

   1.3 Project Scope And Research Objectives:
   The scope of the research project is focused on understanding consumer
   behavior of the residents of Chandigarh in respect of Western fast food
   offerings. The key research objective is-
     * To understand preferences of consumers in respect of Western Fast
       food offerings in Chandigarh, and identifying factors to be
       considered to encourage buying.

   The research will focus on how consumers in Chandigarh perceive and
   utilize Western fast food offerings in general as well as certain
   categories of it, not to identify how to successfully promote one
   specific brand.

   The results of this study must be as useful to the maker of Brand 1 in
   country A as they are to the distributors of Brand 2 from country B.
   The study gains importance from both the producer and consumer’s point
   of view, as it will identify drawbacks, limitations and constraints
   existing in the Fast food marketing structure.

   1.4 Key Research Questions Addressed in the Study:
     * Who are the consumers of these Western fast food offerings?
     * How do consumers in Chandigarh typically become acquainted with
       Western fast food offerings?
     * What are consumers looking for in Western fast food offerings?
     * What could be done to encourage purchasing of Western fast food
       offerings?

   1.5 Limitations of the Study:
     * The research project concerns a pilot project on a limited number
       of individual western fast food offerings only, which may be
       extended to an envisioned continuous annual research program. After
       preliminary discussions with the major Western fast food sellers in
       Chandigarh three product categories have been selected i.e.
       burgers, pizzas, and
     * The study has the limitation of time, finance and other resource
       availability associated with a student researcher.
     * Further, because of demographic variations the results of this
       study are mostly applicable to the regions and to locations with
       similar conditions.

   LITERATURE SURVEY
   2.1 Introduction to Literature Review:
   In order to provide a framework for the primary data research, first
   the key concepts about food consumption behavior have been set out.
   Next to that, information has been gathered on the background and
   determinants of food consumption behavior of Indians in general and in
   Chandigarh in particular, followed by an overview of the food market
   for Western fast food products.

   2.2 Food consumption behavior
   The key objective of this research project is to learn more about local
   consumer preferences in Chandigarh in respect of Western fast food
   products, especially the way they perceive and utilize these products.
   In order to understand consumer preferences one needs to understand the
   elements that drive consumer behavior in the buying process.

   The buying process can be summarized as follows^4 :
   The starting point of each buying decision is that the potential
   consumer needs to be aware of the products involved i.e. Western fast
   food products. Once aware, the consumer will decide whether to buy a
   certain product or not, based on his/her beliefs and attitudes which
   determine his/her preferences for a certain product. A belief is a
   descriptive thought that a person holds about something or a
   perception, which can be based on knowledge, opinion or faith. An
   attitude describes someone’s enduring favorable or unfavorable
   cognitive evaluations, emotional feelings, and action tendencies toward
   some object or idea. Preferences are the selections that people make
   when all food products are equally and simultaneously available i.e.
   the final short-list of alternative products the consumer chooses from.
   Perceptions, attitudes and preferences are all part of food consumption
   behavior. Awareness is a necessary condition for consumption behavior
   to occur.

   Food consumption behavior is determined by underlying factors that
   drive this behavior. Literature shows different ways of looking at
   those driving factors, some of which are discussed below. One view
   considers the food consumption process to circle around two key
   elements, being the choice (decision to buy) and the actual purchase
   (exchange of resources) which are determined by factors as who buys,
   what to buy, frequency of purchases, types of foods which are eaten,
   who eats what, the time and occasion during which certain foods are
   consumed, the symbolic meaning of food, and attitudes toward foods.

   Figure 2.1 Consumer buying process:
   Figure 2.1 Consumer buying process:

   Others suggest that both cognitive and motivational factors must be
   considered when studying food consumption behavior. Cognitive factors
   are related to the question of how people think about food including
   attitudes and preferences, meal patterns (e.g., the food products that
   comprise a supper) and cultural availability^5.

   Motivational factors relate to what a person induces to act.
   Motivational factors include values, physical and social food needs,
   and obstacles to be overcome in buying and preparing food. For example,
   tofu has been discussed as a food product that has faced resistance in
   North America because the cooking skills required for using tofu are
   relatively time consuming and complicated by North American food
   preparation standards.

   Finally, another way of categorizing driving factors behind food
   consumption behavior is to distinguish between biological factors (such
   as age, gender, etc.), sociological factors (such as ethnicity,
   education, religion, traditions, etc.), household familial factors
   (such as food sharing behavior, purchasing power, etc.) and cognitive
   factors (such as body image, healthful foods, etc.).

   Recent studies of food consumption behavior of the people of India
   shows that India’s multiracial society with it’s large expatriate
   population drawn from all over has led to a diverse and rich variety of
   food types being available to consumers. Perceived important factors
   that has influenced the diversity in consumer tastes and preferences
   are:
     * Traditional Indian (local) culture
     * Religion
     * Newer trading relationships with North America, Japan, China and
       Europe
     * Urbanization
     * Free access to international media
     * Available local foodstuffs and ingredients
     * The scope of advertising and promotion
     * Government policy and campaigns on food and health related issues
     * Social status of consumers and purchase decision makers

   The first two categorizations discussed above have been used in
   gathering and analyzing information in the primary data research stage.
   The last categorization of factors discussed above has been used as a
   basis for gathering and analyzing information in the secondary data
   research phase. Moreover, when designing the standard questionnaires
   for the primary data research, specific relevant factors resulting from
   studies of the Indian food market have been kept in mind.

   2.3 Food Traditions in India:
   The role of tradition is particularly noteworthy when discussing food
   consumption behavior and the willingness to try unfamiliar foods, as it
   is often strongly linked with eating habits.

   In the mid 1990’s, a spate of global fast food chains entered India to
   capture a part of Indian fast food segment. But they found it difficult
   to establish themselves. Gaining acceptance locally and blending into
   the Indian culture proved difficult. With regards to their menu,
   positioning and advertising, MNC fast food chains had to face lot of
   problems in getting accepted by the Indian consumer. After initial
   problems they realized that it was important to combine the local
   tradition and food habits of the consumers, with their products.
   Although few players were able to form pan-Indian retail supply chains,
   the retail market is unlikely to be a single entity. For example, food
   retailing in Chennai, Kolkata and Chandigarh is vastly different in
   terms of shopping habits and consumer tastes. Many such differences
   will remain^6.

   With more than five thousand ethnic communities represented, India has
   a very diverse population. Each region and sub region in India has
   distinct food traditions and preferences. Indian consumers typically
   maintain their distinct food habits even after migrating to different
   parts of the country. In large cities and metropolitan areas, some
   restaurants serve only specialty regional foods. Some regional fast
   foods such as samosa, kababs, chola bhatura, pakoda, aloo-paratha,
   poori-bhaji, dosa, and sambarvada are popular among Indian consumers
   and are available in both specialty and multi-cuisine restaurants
   throughout India.

   Most Indians prefer to eat home-cooked foods and take immense pride in
   the varieties of food cooked at home. For most Indians, home-cooked
   foods are considered fresh, healthy, and inexpensive. Given the
   distinct dietary habits and food preference of Indian consumers, it is
   not surprising that until the early 1990s Western fast food chains had
   largely ignored Indian markets. As a result, Nirula’s, the only notable
   Indian fast food chain, has been able to dominate the Indian market in
   fast food service sales^7.

   In an interview, Vikram Bakshi, MD, McDonald’s Delhi, said that even
   though the Indian outfit stuck to its core taste that grew on consumers
   from ‘bland’ to ‘unique’ in three years, with no change factored in by
   the fast food chain, McDonald’s menu still was about 75% different from
   its global menu^8.

   Similarly, Gautam Advani, Chief of Marketing, Domino’s Pizza, in an
   interview said, “the Indian palate is very definitive- people are
   extremely finicky and choosy, not too willing to experiment. Food
   tastes vary from region to region.”

   The Indian cuisine is as diverse as its culture, languages, its racial
   structure, its geographic regions and its climate. Every major region
   of India brings its own unique dishes and subtle variations to popular
   dishes. The skill lies in the subtle blending of a variety of spices to
   enhance rather than overwhelm the basic flavor of a particular dish.
   These spices are also used as appetizers and digestives. Use of
   particular spices such as Coriander, Cumin, Fenugreek, Asafetida, etc.,
   give Indian foods its distinct flavor. The cooking skill lies in the
   subtle blending of a variety of spices to enhance the basic flavor of a
   particular dish.

   Milk products like ghee (processed butter) and dahi (Yogurt), a variety
   of dals (Lentils) and regional vegetables are other common ingredients
   in Indian cooking. Vegetables naturally differ across regions and with
   seasons. The style of cooking vegetables is dependent upon the main
   dish with which they are served. For example Sarson ka saag (mustard
   greens) is a perfect complement for the Makke ki Roti (corn flat bread)
   eaten in Punjab, while sambhar (lentil soup) goes great with Idlis
   (steamed rice cakes) eaten in South India.
   Most of the Indian cuisine today is a perfect blend of native Hindu
   foods and unique culinary practices brought by various settlers.
   Although a number of religions exist in India, the two most influential
   to Indian cuisine are the Hindu and the Muslim traditions.

   The Muslim culinary tradition is most evident in dishes like Mughlai
   food, kababs, Kormas, koftas (meat-balls), biryani (rice with meats),
   rogan josh, and preparations from the clay oven or tandoor like
   tandoori rotis and tandoori chicken.

   Chapatis or rotis (unleavened flat bread) or parathas (unleavened
   layered flat bread), rice and an assortment of accessories like dals,
   fried vegetables, curries, chutney, and pickles are typical north
   Indian dishes.

   South Indian food is largely non-greasy, roasted and steamed. Rice is
   the staple diet and forms the basis of every meal. It is usually served
   with sambhar, rasam (a thin soup), dry and curried vegetables and a
   curd preparation called pachadi. Coconut is an important ingredient in
   all South Indian food. The South Indian dosa (rice pancakes), idli
   (steamed rice cakes) and vada, which are made of fermented rice and
   dal, are now popular throughout the country. The popular dishes from
   Kerala are appams (a rice pancake) and thick stews.

   Most of the sweetmeats in Indian desserts are from Bengal region e.g.
   rasagulla, jalebi, sandesh, rasamalai and gulab-jamuns. A majority of
   sweetmeats are milk preparations usually soaked in syrup. Kheer (rice
   pudding) and Seviyan (Vermicelli pudding) are other common northern
   desserts. Desserts from the south include the Mysore pak and the creamy
   payasum.

   North Indian food is generally rich, with abundant use of milk products
   (e.g. butter, cream, ghee which is processed butter.), spices as
   compared to other parts of India. As Chandigarh is the capital of two
   states viz- Punjab and Haryana, food traditions in Chandigarh have
   greater influence of these two states. 98% of the North Indian diet has
   traditionally been of plant origin. Mutton, poultry, fish are generally
   well liked. Wheat in the form of bread, pastries are more common in
   North India as compared to other parts of India where products made of
   rice are dominant.

   Contrary to popular belief, however, India is not a predominantly
   vegetarian country. About 20% of India’s population is completely
   vegetarian. A closer look at state-level food habits in India reveals
   that food preferences vary widely among the country’s 30 states and six
   union territories^9.

   While part of this vegetarianism is economic, a more compelling force
   is ethical and even religious. Jains avoid meat totally, while many
   Buddhists in India are vegetarian. Brahmins, ‘Saivite’ non-Brahmins of
   South India and several ‘Vaishnavite’ sects across the country avoid
   meat. Interestingly, though, Brahmins of East India, Kashmir, and the
   ‘Saraswats’ of the southwest eat fish and mutton. But even among
   meat-eaters, beef is taboo^10.

   2.4 Fast Food in India:
   The concept of fast food isn’t new. Early in the 19th century, at the
   start of the Industrial Age when people had to work 12 to 14 hours a
   day, there was scarcely any time for long breaks for eating. The first
   snack bars and kiosks arose in front of factories. Today, quick meals
   outside the home have become an essential part of our lifestyle.

   2.4.1 Introduction to Fast food:
   The term “fast food” means just that. However, the boundary between
   fast foods and traditional dishes is fluid. In particular, it’s
   difficult to provide a qualitative distinction. Fast foods can also
   include salads and fruit in addition to classic offerings such as
   hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, patties, French-fries, pizzas, chips
   and so on. The best way to distinguish fast foods is to use formal
   characteristics:

   Time required^10a – those who eat fast foods do not want to spend a lot
   of time selecting and eating, and if necessary will eat standing or
   walking, on the bus, park bench, or at work. The variety of foods and
   beverages is usually very limited. Fast food frequently does not come
   with knives and forks, making it “finger food.” When silverware, cups
   and plates are necessary, they are disposable.

   The characteristics of fast food, therefore, are that they require
   little time, offer a limited selection, are finger food, and the
   silverware and plates are disposable. These characteristics readily
   illustrate the difference from traditional dining culture. Many people
   equate fast foods with convenience foods. This is incorrect since
   convenience products are often eaten at home. They require active
   participation because they must be heated, stirred, baked, thawed,
   etc., and are supplemented with other foods.

   There are three general categories of fast food businesses:
   1. Self-service restaurants with a fast-food palette like McDonalds,
   Wendy’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, etc.

   2. Take-out (or take-away) businesses that sell ready-to-eat foods and
   beverages.

   3.”On the street corner” hot-dog stands and snack stands with counters
   or a pair of stand-up tables.

   2.4.2 Fast food Industry Overview:
   Fast food is a food prepared and served quickly at a fast food
   restaurant or a shop. It is served usually in a carton or bags in order
   to minimize cost. Fast food outlets often provide take away or take out
   foods in addition to sit down services. Fast food is a multi billion
   industry continuing to grow at a rapid pace in coming years.

   Fast food is often highly processed and prepared in an industrial
   fashion i.e., with standard ingredients, methodical cooking and
   production methods. Logistical planning and outsourcing of ingredients
   are crucial factors in keeping the cost of operations low.

   2.4.3 The Start of Fast food Culture:
   The concept of fast food pops up during 1920s.The 1950s first witnessed
   their rapid proliferation. Several factors that contributed to this
   explosive growth in 50’s were:

   (1) America’s love affair with the automobiles.
   (2) The construction of a major new highway system.
   (3) The development of sub-urban communities.
   (4) The baby boom subsequent to world war second.

   “Fast-food chains initially catered to automobile owners in suburbia.
   The notion of “fast” food reflected American culture in which speed and
   efficiency are highly prized ^11.”

   2.5 India – Emerging Market for Global Players:
   Organized food retailing industry is still at infancy stage with share
   less than 1% of food retail market size in India (See Appendix-IV, pg-
   115; Comparison of Organized and Unorganized fast food Outlets). The
   percentage share held by food service of total consumer expenditure on
   food has increased from a very low base to stand at 2.6% in 2001.
   Eating at home remains very much ingrained in Indian culture and
   changes in eating habits are very slow moving with barriers to eating
   out entrenched in certain sectors of Indian society.

   Traditionally, eating out was looked down upon in Indian society. The
   growth in nuclear families, particularly in urban India, exposure to
   global media and Western cuisine, and an increasing number of women
   joining the workforce have had an impact on eating out trends.
   Increasingly, eating out is becoming synonymous with entertainment. And
   very often, it is preferred as a time saving option to cooking. Not
   surprisingly, takeaways are becoming increasingly popular. India is
   among the top three countries globally having highest number of people
   in the spending capacities in the age group of 25-49 yrs.

   India is placed at the second rank in the 2004 global retail
   development index; an annual ranking of retail investment
   attractiveness among 30 emerging markets. The lack of consolidation and
   model retail concepts in India presents better opportunity to global
   players. Over 400 shopping malls, multiplexes, fast food giants,
   restaurants etc. are in planning or construction stage across the
   country^12.

   2.5.1 Market Size &amp; Major Players:
   Fast food is one of the worlds largest growing food type. India’s fast
   food industry is growing by 40% a year and is expected to generate a
   billion dollars in sales by 2005. The multinational segment of Indian
   fast food industry is up to Rs.6 bn, a figure expected to zoom to Rs.70
   bn by 2006. By 2006, the value of Indian dairy products is expected to
   be Rs.1, 00,000 million. In last 6 years, foreign investment in this
   sector stood at Rs. 3600 million, which is about one-fourth of total
   investment made in this sector. Because of the availability of raw
   material for fast food, Global chains are flooding into the country^13.

   There are approximately 22,000 registered restaurants in India. In
   addition, there are more than 100,000 dhabas (small roadside food
   stalls) that sell a variety of foods in cities and on highways. By
   1998, there were approximately 1,568 registered hotels in India, half
   of which have their own restaurants^14. In addition, large to
   medium-range canteens serve the food needs of various institutions such
   as hospitals, prisons, defense establishments, schools, colleges and
   universities, railways, airlines, government establishments, and
   private companies. Since 1994, India’s food imports have been growing
   more than 37% per year. Half of India’s food imports are agricultural
   items such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, wheat, and nuts. One of the
   significant problems of the Indian food industry is an inefficient food
   chain between farmers and consumers.

   About 20% of India’s food production is wasted because of too many
   intermediaries, poor infrastructure, and poor transportation
   facilities. Considerable inefficiency in the food distribution system
   cuts farmers’ income while raising consumer food prices. Although India
   is the world’s third largest food producer, its processing industry is
   very small compared to other countries in Asia, Europe, and the United
   States. Despite the lack of a well-developed food processing industry,
   India’s imports of processed consumer foods have traditionally remained
   low. Since the early 1990s, India’s food service sales have
   significantly increased. India’s processed and fast food markets have
   shown considerable potential for growth^15

   Dominated by McDonalds having as many as 75 outlets. Domino’s pizza is
   present in around 100 locations. Pizza hut is also catching up and it
   has planned to establish 125 outlets at the end of 2006. Subways have
   established around 40 outlets. Nirula’s is established in North India
   only. However, it claims to cater 50,000 guests everyday.

   Major players in fast food are:
     * McDonalds
     * Nirula’s
     * Pizza hut
     * Dominos pizza
     * Pizza corner
     * KFC
     * Subway

   Multinational fast food companies have given domestic competition a run
   for its money. While McDonalds sells more than Nirula’s, Pizza Hut and
   Dominos are doing more business than Pizza Corner. Within nine years of
   their existence in India since 1996, the multinationals have grown at a
   faster pace than their Indian counterparts. According to industry
   estimates, in 2001, while McDonald’s clocked a turnover of about Rs 125
   crore (Rs 1.25 billion), the home-grown Nirula’s, which has been
   present in the country since 1934, could only garner Rs 100 crore (Rs 1
   billion) turnover. Also, both Domino’s Pizza Hut and Dominos clocked a
   turnover of about Rs 60 crore (Rs 600 million) but Pizza Corner lagged
   behind with a turnover of Rs. 25-30 crore (Rs. 250- 300 million).

   The main reason behind the success of the multinational chains is their
   expertise in product development, sourcing practices, quality
   standards, service levels and standardized operating procedures in
   their restaurants, a strength that they have developed over years of
   experience around the world. The homegrown chains have in the past few
   years of competition with the MNC’s, learnt a few things but there is
   still a lot of scope for improvement. We have applied our learning
   experience from other countries in all the processes including
   consistency, marketing, distribution and training to the local market
   conditions. It’s now that the domestic chains have realized the
   importance of such practices. Nirula’s is thus beefing up its
   organizational structure. Another key reason behind the success of
   multinationals is the ability to attract youngsters. While McDonalds
   has been able to attract people below 30, Dominos is targeting the
   ‘convenience-seeker.’

   Nirula’s, on the other hand, is known to appeal more to the 30-plus
   consumers. Small wonder, Nirula’s has launched its ’21’ range if ice
   cream cafes to attract the younger lot. The challenge for the homegrown
   chains is also to reinvent themselves to appeal to the younger
   consumers. However, the domestic chains are at an advantage since they
   understand the Indian consumer behavior and eating habits and their
   product offerings have been tailored accordingly. Multinational chains
   like McDonalds and Pizza Hut are still on a learning curve trying to
   customize their menu to the Indian taste and food preferences. Pizza
   Hut, for example, launched its ‘masala’ range of pizzas and also opened
   the world’s first 100 percent vegetarian outlet in India. Domino, on
   the other hand, has launched its ‘peppy paneer pizza’ keeping in mind
   the Indian taste buds. The food service market in India is estimated to
   be around Rs.36, 000 crore (Rs. 360 billion), of which the urban fast
   food quick service restaurants is around Rs. 1, 000 crore (Rs10
   billion)^16. This segment is witnessing high growth of around 25-30 per
   cent per annum so the market has a lot of potential to grow.

   The Global Agriculture Information Report for the HRI food service
   sector by the US Embassy (2005) states that there are approximately
   500, 000 restaurants in the organized sector (restaurants with more
   than twenty seats and restaurant menu), mostly serving ethnic cuisines;
   this number is expected to grow at about 7-8 percent annually for next
   few years because of increasing urbanization and increasing disposable
   incomes.

   After a slow start, Western-style fast food restaurants have grown
   impressively at 12-15 percent annually over recent years. Most foreign
   chains (McDonald’s, Dominos, Pizza Hut, Subway, KFC, and TGIF) and
   local chains (Nirula’s and Pizza Corner) are doing well in major
   cities, and are expanding into smaller cities. Most of these fast food
   chains have developed a range of Indian-styled products to suit local
   preferences (such as the Maharaja chicken burger, veggie burger, etc.).
   Although these chains procure most of their products locally, several
   products such as French fries, specialty cheese, some meats/seafood,
   flavors, condiments, and other ingredients are often imported.

   2.7. Factors Affecting the Fast Food Industry in India:
   Income distribution: The long-term growth trend in India is improving.
   The past three decades have seen a steady acceleration. Average annual
   growth in GDP per head climbed from 1.2% in the 1970s to 3% in the
   1980s and 4% in the 1990s. From 1972 to 1982, GDP growth averaged 3.5%
   a year—the so-called “Hindu rate of growth.” As a result of India’s
   decade-long liberalization of economic policies, the growth rate
   climbed to 6% from 1992-2002 and is likely to reach 7% by 2010^22. If
   this rate is maintained, GDP per person will double in only 18 years.
   However, high GDP growth is confined to only the few states with
   coastal access and high levels of urbanization. The fastest-growing
   Indian states in 1991-2001 were Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, West
   Bengal, and Gujrat. These states enjoyed annual average economic growth
   of 6-8%, which is comparable to East Asian economies during the same
   period. But the economies of poor states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,
   Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Assam grew by a dismal annual average of 2%
   over the same period^23.

   Not surprisingly, income distribution is highly skewed in India. Just
   20% of the richest Indians share more than 40% of the national income.
   According to a study by National Applied Economic Research (2004)^ 22,
   the number of households with an annual income over Indian Rupees (Rs.)
   1 crore (US $228,351) has grown by 26% since 1995-96 to 20, 000 in
   2001-02. By 2009-10, it will increase more than seven times to 1,40,000
   households. In the Rs. 50 lakh (US $114,180) to Rs. 1 crore (US $228,
   351) bracket, the number of households is expected to increase from
   40,000 in 2001-02 to over 250,000 in 2009-10. In the 11 years following
   1989-90, the total number of households increased by 32%, although the
   average size of Indian households has declined from 5.9 people per
   household in 1990 to 5.2 in 2001. What is important is that the number
   of low-income urban households has been approximately halved, from 14.9
   million households in 1989-90 to 7.6 million in 2001-02.

   The number of low-income rural households has also declined from 69
   million in 1989-90 to 58 million in 2001-02. The growth in incomes in
   the top band has been experienced by both urban and rural households,
   both of which have roughly doubled as a share of the total population
   over the 1990s^24. The members of these households have higher
   disposable income and have shown greater propensity to spend on fast
   foods. There is continuous increase in the per capita income of the
   Indian citizens. More income in hand results into more spending in
   comforts and entertainment and thus results into more and more spending
   on fast and ready to serve kind of foods.

   Economic liberalization: With economic liberalization of 1991, more
   foreign and private industries entered the Indian market that result
   into income generation of the Indian residents. More income resulted
   into more savings, more savings resulted into more investment, and more
   investment resulted into the overall growth of the economy.

   Large Population Growth and Urbanization: According to the 2001 census,
   India’s population grew at a rate of around 2% a year during the
   previous decade. This was a marked decline from earlier decades of
   population growth of around 3% annually. Nevertheless, India added 181
   million people between 1990-2001, more than the total population of
   Brazil^25.

   According to the forecast of Goldman Sachs (an American investment
   bank), the reason why India is expected to outperform Brazil, Russia,
   and China, as well as the “rich world” (i.e., United States, Canada,
   France, Germany, United Kingdom), is that it is the only country where
   the population will continue to grow for the next 50 years and where
   the proportion of working-age people will increase well into the
   2020s^26. The percentage of urban population in India has increased
   from 21% in 1975 to more than 28% in 2004. It is likely to increase to
   36% in 2025^27.

   Most high-income Indians prefer to live in urban areas. Over 70% of
   affluent urban Indian consumers live in the ten most populated and
   cosmopolitan cities in India: Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai,
   Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Ludhiana, and Nagpur. The number of
   dual income households, where both husband and wife work, is slowly
   increasing in urban areas. Like their husbands, full-time working-women
   spend most of their time away from home. As a result, there has been a
   dramatic change in the way Indian working wives shop and organize
   family meals. Packaged rice, prepared yoghurt, packets of flour, frozen
   chickens, and marinated mutton (goat or lamb meat) are fast replacing
   curdling, grinding, and handling of market-bought fowls and haunches of
   mutton. Not surprisingly, even some Indian consumers have started
   opting for meals away from home on working days.

   The growing popularity of Delhi’s Waiters on Wheels (WOW), a supply
   agency delivering meals to people’s doorsteps from 30 different
   restaurants at the same price as one would pay in the restaurants, is
   an example of India’s changing food service landscape^28. High income
   and growing urbanization have also contributed to a shift in the
   traditional Indian food habits. High-income urban dwellers are seeking
   variety in their choice of foods and are willing to spend more on
   international cuisine, including fast foods. Consequently, a growing
   number of domestic fast food outlets, home delivery, take-away
   restaurants, and American restaurant chains, such as Kentucky Fried
   Chicken (KFC), TGI Friday’s, Domino’s Pizza, Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, and
   Baskin Robbins, have opened in the last few years. India being a second
   largest country in terms of population possesses large potential market
   for all the products/services. This results into entry of large number
   of fast food players in the country.

   Relaxation in rules and regulations: With the economic liberalization
   of 1991, most of the tariff and non-tariff barriers from the Indian
   boundaries are either removed or minimized. This helped significantly
   the MNC’s to enter in the country.

   Growth in number of women’s in the work force: There is increase in the
   number of women work force in the recent years because of the
   improvement in the literacy rate and also because of the large number
   of jobs now available because of the entry of foreign and private
   players in the Indian market.

   Menu diversification: Increase in consumption of pizzas, burgers,
   sandwiches and other type of fast foods.

   2.8 Problems of Fast Food Industry in India:
   Environmental friendly products cost high: Government is legislating
   laws in order to keep check on the fast food industry and it is
   emphasizing more on the usage of biodegradable and environment friendly
   products. But associated with this issue is the problem that fast food
   player faces, which is the cost, associated with the environment
   friendly product. They cost much higher then the normal products that
   companies use for packaging or wrapping their products.

   Balance between societal expectation and company’s economic objectives:
   It becomes important to balance a society’s expectation regarding
   environment with the economic burden of protecting the environment.
   Thus, one can see that one side pushes for higher standards and other
   side tries to beat the standard back, thereby making it an arm
   wrestling and mind-boggling exercise.
   Health related issues (obesity): Studies have shown that a typical fast
   food has very high density and food with high density causes people to
   eat more than they usually need. Changes in diet coupled with
   stress-filled lives and more sedentary modern existences are beginning
   to take their toll on the consumers’ health. Basic nutrition is simple,
   yet there is mass confusion about what to eat and what effects a
   particular food has, and the reason for all of this misinformation is
   that it benefits food producers to have an innocent flock of customers
   who are left uncertain of how to judge what is healthy and what is not.

   A recent article^29states that India is becoming a nation of obese,
   increasingly exposed to various food hazards, largely thanks to the
   lies and evil ways of large corporations that will stop at nothing to
   increase their profits. There is an excessive consumption of pizzas,
   noodles, ice-creams, beef/ham/cheese burgers, which constitute the
   universally available fast food. These constitute junk food having
   empty calories, which means this kind of food contains the calories
   that are not particularly helpful to one’s body. These days there is an
   emphasis on taste rather than nutrition. Convenience foods are
   manufactured commercially and on a large scale, and consequently are
   low in nutrition. The result is that 25 per cent of males and 36 per
   cent females above the age of 20 years are overweight.

   Obesity was earlier the problem of the developed countries, but now
   even the developing countries are facing the threat. Technology has
   made it easy to follow sedentary life styles, which must be avoided at
   any cost.

   Green Sensitivity: In India, there is a vocal group of environmental
   and animal activists who oppose the entry of fast-food chains like KFC
   and McDonald’s. Maneka Gandhi, former environment minister in the
   central government, and Dr. Vandana Shiva, Director of the Research
   Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, are the prominent
   leaders of this group. According to this group’s campaign, junk food
   chains like McDonald’s and KFC destroy ecological balance and cause
   severe behavioral disorders because of their fatty and unhealthy foods,
   which have excessive levels of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Besides,
   they also campaign that these food chains are anti-poor and cater only
   to the rich segment of the Indian society.

   2.9 Conclusion:
   Multinationals in India often wonder why their marketing plans often
   come unstuck. The answer usually given is: “India is different’.
   Serious inquiry begins when we ask how Indian consumers are different.
   It is observed the success of fast foods arose from the changes in our
   living conditions:
     * Many women or both parents now work
     * There are increased numbers of single-parent households
     * Long distances to school and work are common
     * Usually, lunch times are short

   There’s often not enough time or opportunity to shop carefully for
   groceries, or to cook and eat with one’s family. Especially on
   weekdays, fast food outside the home is the only solution. Today, only
   40% of young college-age people eat lunch at home. Mostly teenagers and
   young adults use fast food facilities when there is shortage of time.
   According to studies, 66% of young men and 33% of women in Switzerland
   eat one to two hamburgers a week, and half the teenagers eat
   French-fries once a week. The large chains have pulled out all the
   stops of modern marketing, targeting primarily young consumers. They
   entice their potential customers with TV spots, children’s parties,
   gifts for small children, and an ambiance that is generally child- and
   teenager friendly. Large distributors, bakers and butchers, snack bars,
   and so on, also exploit the fast food trend and offer more take-out
   products.

   It’s obvious that these campaigns are at the expense of traditional
   home dining culture. Experts have coined the term “McDonaldization” to
   describe this phenomenon.

   Some noticeable facts about fast food industry are: Fast food had
   experienced fast growth in past decade. Changing lifestyles, breakdown
   of joint family system, increasing number of working women’s and
   western influence in urban areas are fuelling the demand for fast food.

   India already has the entire requirement for a head start in Fast food
   industry. Basic materials such as food, vegetables and meat can be
   sourced locally or easily imported if local availability is not
   adequate.

   Food outlets are just beginning to appear in India’s big cities and
   this is a time for international chains to set a foothold. There will
   be increase in competition in the near future. Studies indicate that
   the highest percentage increase in units can be expected in the
   unorganized street stalls/kiosks sector. The one who will better
   understand and get closer to its target customer will win the game.

   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
   3.1 Introduction to Research Methodology:
   The present research is based on both secondary and primary data
   collection. Since the topic encourages facile projections and
   speculations for the future, the study has attempted to quote hard data
   in order to support viewpoints. In case where qualitative data and
   opinions have been used the researcher has made sure to present
   differing perspectives before coming to a conclusion.

   3.2 Sources of Data:
   The project work has been carried out in two phases:
     * First phase involved the process of secondary data collection that
       was done by studying issue related books, journals, articles and
       company reports.
     * Based on the results of the first stage the second stage involved
       the process of primary data collection through the questionnaire
       method. The standard questionnaire covered the awareness, attitude
       and behavior towards western fast food products in general and
       three selected product categories in particular.

   3.3 Data Gathering, Processing and Analysis:
   3.3.1 Secondary Data:
   Secondary data has been collected from company reports, websites, and
   literature and company statistics. A full list of sources has been
   included in the Annexure. An in-depth analysis of a number of case
   studies and reports has been carried out based on the secondary data
   available from these sources

   3.3.2 Primary data:
   Primary data was collected from a selected sample of respondents
   following the Simple Random Method. Responses were scaled according
   various variables and clusters were formed to come to the findings,
   discussion and conclusion of the research. The sample comprises of 115
   consumers, selected at random. In this stage consumers were interviewed
   near fast food restaurants and information was gathered about their
   awareness, attitudes and preferences towards western fast food
   offerings.

   To make sure that the sample represented the entire Western fast food
   consuming population in the city of Chandigarh, the sample has been
   selected on ‘sector’ wise basis. The city is divided according to
   ‘sectors’ and fast food outlets were selected such that the sample
   represented the entire population of Chandigarh. A full list of the
   fast food outlets has been given in the Appendix to this research.
   The interpretation and analysis, which comprises of both quantitative
   and qualitative nature, is based on both the secondary and primary
   data, and may therefore be considered to be of a more subjective
   nature.

   The variables selected for consideration in the analysis are based on
   various factors of the consumers in the town such as demographic
   factors like age, household income, occupation, psychographic factors
   such as attitudes and beliefs of the consumers towards Western fast
   food offerings, behavioral factors such as brand loyalty, price
   sensitivity, frequency of purchase and so on.

   Once the initial variable list was developed, an analysis of the
   percentage response for each variable was undertaken to find out the
   differences in each variable in the responses from the consumers.

   3.4 Location of the Study: Chandigarh
   Chandigarh is a very modern town, in the northern part of India that is
   considered as one of the beautiful cities in Asia. It is designed for
   50 ‘sectors’ with the exception of the unlucky number 13! Each sector
   is a self-complete block about a Kilometer in length by 0.8Km width.

   3.5 Trends in the Indian Market:

   Marketing to children’s: Fast food outlets in India target children’s
   as their major customers. They introduce varieties of things that will
   attract the children’s attention and by targeting children’s they
   automatically target their parents because their parents always
   accompany children’s.

   Low level customer commitment: Because of the large number of food
   retail outlets and also because of the tendency of customers to switch
   from one product to other (as food is one area, where customer wants to
   try everything new that comes to the market), this industry faces low
   level customer commitment.

   Value added technology services: There is continuous improvement in the
   technology as far as fast food market in India is considered. The
   reason behind that is food is a perishable item and in order to ensure
   that it remains fresh for a longer period of time, there is a need for
   continuous up gradation in technology. Earlier, Indian people preferred
   eating at home but now with the change in trend there is also need for
   improvement and up gradation of technology in food sector.

   Attracting different segments of the market: Fast food outlets are
   introducing varieties of products in order to cater the demands of each
   and every segment of the market. They are introducing all categories of
   product so that people of all age, sex, class, income group etc can
   come and become a customer of their food line.

   3.6 Challenges for the Fast Food Industry in India:
   Social and cultural implications of Indians switching to western
   breakfast food: Generally, Hindus avoid all foods that are believed to
   inhibit physical and spiritual development. Eating meat is not
   explicitly prohibited, but many Hindus are vegetarian because they
   adhere to the concept of ahimsa. Those seeking spiritual unity may
   avoid garlic and onions. The concept of purity influences Hindu food
   practices. Products from cows (e.g., milk, yogurt, ghee-clarified
   butter) are considered pure. Pure foods can improve the purity of
   impure foods when they are prepared together. Some foods, such as beef
   or alcohol, are innately polluted and can never be made pure. But now,
   Indians are switching to fast food that contain all those things that
   are considered impure or against there beliefs. Some traditional and
   fundamentalist are against this transformation of food habit and number
   of times they provoke their counterparts to revolt against such foods.
   And that is what happened when McDonald’s decided to enter the
   complexity of Indian business landscape, counting only on its “fast
   food global formula”, without any apparent previous cultural
   training^29.

   Positioning for the selected segments: Positioning is an integral part
   of strategy for a new service provider. Once the target segment or
   market is clear, the service marketer has to position itself
   appropriately for its target segment. Even in case of a mature
   business, a service marketer needs to reaffirm its positioning in the
   minds of target customers. At times, a subtle shift in positioning may
   also be necessary to keep up with the changing consumer preferences or
   to cope with the challenges from the competitors.

   Briefly, the positioning is a mental image or picture that a service
   provider would like to have about itself in the consumers mind. It is a
   deliberate attempt at building an identity of a certain kind for the
   service. For example, McDonald’s in India has a slightly up market
   image than in the US, where it is viewed as cheap American fast food.
   Since a hamburger is an everyday item of American food, it made sense
   for McDonald’s to develop the positioning. In India that slot is
   already occupied by a variety of Indian alternatives. For example, the
   idli-dosa corner food joints in the south, the parantha serving stalls
   in the north, or the tea and samosa corners of Kolkata. Therefore the
   mind space that most of the organized fast food restaurants had tried
   to occupy is of two types- One, the affluent westernized teenager and,
   Second, the modern, upscale family which is possibly driven by children
   who enjoy the feeling of eating outside their household. Positioning
   has lot to do with the target segment to which we chose to market, and
   has elements like price, packaging, communication and ambience, which
   reinforces the positioning, attempted by a company.

   Emphasis on the usage of biodegradable products: Glasses, silverware,
   plates and cloth napkins are never provided with fast food. Instead,
   paper plates and napkins, polyurethane containers, plastic cups and
   tableware, drinking cartons or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles
   are used, and these are all disposable. Many of these items are tossed
   in the garbage instead of being recycled, or even worse, merely thrown
   on the ground. This burdens nature unnecessarily and squanders raw
   materials. In order to reduce soil and water pollution, government now
   emphasizes more on the usage of biodegradable products.

   Retrenchment of employees: Most of new industries will be capital
   intensive and may drive local competitors, which have more workers, out
   of business.

   Profit repatriation: Repatriation of profits is another area of concern
   for Indian economy. As when multinational enters any country, people
   and government hope that it will increase the employment rate and
   result in economic growth. However, with the multinational operation,
   host country experiences these benefits for a short time period. In
   long run neither employment increases (because of capital intensive
   nature of MNC’s) nor it increases the GDP or GNP because whatever MNC’s
   earn they repatriate that profit back to their home country.

   DATA ANALYSIS
   4. Consumer Analysis:
   Based on the results of the secondary data collection 115 interviews
   were carried out to quantify the awareness, attitudes and behavior
   towards western fast food products in the city of Chandigarh on the
   basis of a questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on
   western fast food in general and three selected product categories in
   particular.

   4.6 Key Findings:
   4.6.1 Factors influencing product choice:
   In this section the main factors that influence choice (decision to
   buy) and purchase (exchange of resources) of Western food products are
   described based on the results of the response from the consumers.

   Who buys:
   Most selected buyers have the influence of commercial and personal
   sources as to how they became acquainted with Western food products.
   Housewives and elderly buyers tend to be more price sensitive as they
   have limited budget and time to make a purchase. Participants with
   children tend to spend more money on fast foods, and they perceive the
   products are convenient/easy to eat, less time consuming, fresh,
   suitable when socializing, having nicer and strong packaging, and are
   competitively priced compared to local products.

   Most of the participants preferred to shop at organized fast food
   restaurants rather than in street stalls for the following reasons:
     * Shop premises is spacious and clean
     * Good sales service
     * Near to their work place
     * A wide selection of food choices
     * Safe to eat
     * Fresh ingredients used

   But, they also find the Western fast food offerings more expensive as
   compared to local fast food offerings. Older consumers prefer local
   fast food restaurants as compared to Western fast food restaurants. The
   most important reason being that Western fast food restaurants are
   often crowded with youngsters, and they prefer visiting restaurants
   where there is no self-service.

   What to buy:
   Half of the participants are most likely to purchase products, which
   can be consumed as a snack. Fresh offerings are mentioned as items that
   participants are likely to purchase because these food products are
   perceived as clean and hygienic. Beverages are most often mentioned in
   combination with Western fast food items. Most of the participants are
   likely to purchase products that can be consumed as snack every day,
   which is having fewer fats. Frozen pizzas are not bought because people
   rather preferred fresh pizzas at Western restaurants such as Pizza Hut.

   Consumers like fast food offerings with a light sauce such as tomato
   sauce or with a special sauce (chutney) made from fresh vegetables for
   a healthier variant. Consumers are least likely to purchase alcoholic
   (beer, etc.) items because they don’t find it suitable with Western
   fast foods. Frozen offerings (frozen pizzas) also seem as least likely
   buy. All the participants prefer beverages with the Western fast food
   offerings. Participants did not like too oily products and salads are
   also mentioned by most of the buyers as a good combination with the
   offerings.

   Time and occasion:
   Most of the participants consume western fast foods frequently. On an
   average, they consume Western fast foods 3 to 4 times a week at
   restaurants, mostly at breakfast or at lunchtime, but some of them
   consume Western fast food up to 8 times a week. Participants opt for
   western cuisine at fast food restaurants such as McDonalds, Kentucky
   Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and local organized fast food restaurants as
   these are the places that they recognized from their childhood onwards
   and are perceived to provide clean, quick, and reasonably priced food.
   If eating at home most of them prefer ordering the offerings by ‘Home
   delivery’ service.

   Having food with peers, family is preferred by most of the respondents.
   Therefore, they would purchase the best quality food provided that the
   food is fresh, not expensive, has traditional flavors that satisfies
   their simple eating habits. Those who liked Western fast food as meal
   perceived it as cleaner and more hygienic, time saving, better quality
   and less expensive because of in-store promotions, and above all other
   family members, especially children liked the offerings.

   4.6.2 General attitudes towards Western fast food products:
   Most of the participants preferred Western fast food products above
   local fast food products for the following reasons (see also previous
   paragraph):
     * Food is fresher
     * Food has better quality
     * Food is clean and hygienic
     * Food is convenient/easy to eat
     * Food has better nutritional value
     * Food has better/durable packaging
     * Food is recommended by family members, friends or colleagues at
       work

   4.5.3 Motivational factors behind buying behavior:
   In order to obtain a better understanding of consumer motivations
   behind their buying behavior most of the questions were kept open ended
   along with most often occurring motives as understood from the
   secondary data. Participants ranked their most important motives to try
   a Western fast food product for the first time in order of importance
   as follows:

   Motivation mentioned:
     * Word of mouth recommendation from friends/relatives
     * Free sample at a promotional counter
     * Advertising outside the store (e.g. commercial ad on TV or print ad
       from magazines, food magazines particularly)
     * Natural curiosity
     * Food wrapped in a nice packaging
     * Special in-store promotional display
     * Price cuts in the offerings
     * Economic offerings for large groups (e.g. Happy price menus from
       McDonald’s and Combo meals from Pizza hut)

   Other less important motivations mentioned by consumers include food
   freshness directly seen from the packaging, country of origin, detail
   information about the ingredients, and detail information on the
   production process.

   Factors that have the greatest influence on their eating and food
   buying practices are family members, closed related friends, health
   issues, product information, in-store promotions and advertising.
   Most of the consumers agreed that Western fast food products are
   hygienic/safe to eat, easily available, time saving, convenient/easy to
   eat, ideal for social gatherings, enjoyable, give value for money and
   is today’s trend in Chandigarh.

   Salient beliefs mentioned by respondents include cleanliness, safe to
   eat, time saving, convenience, is a trend in Chandigarh, good quality
   standard, eating habit, better nutritional value and freshness.
   Half of the participants agreed that a brand was important when
   choosing Western fast food products because of the following factors:
     * The general image of the company; if the company has a good
       reputation, this was perceived as a guarantee for high quality
       products
     * Standard guarantee in respect of safety and hygiene; well-known
       brands are perceived as more reliable than less well-known brands.

   The most important criteria for participants to pick up certain Western
   food products include taste, store cleanliness, freshness, nutritional
   benefits, food quality, price, country of origin, packaging and brand
   name. All participants are aware that the price of Western fast food
   products is higher than the prices for local food products. However,
   they are willing to pay more for a Western food product over a similar
   local food product because of the following reasons: (1)
   convenient/easy to eat, (2) variety in offerings, (3) food quality is
   more important than price. They have better confidence in the quality
   of Western fast foods.

   On the basis of sensory food characteristics, products having
   traditional Indian flavors are generally preferred over all others.
   Depending on one’s demographic traits, preference may be based on
   money-saving or timesaving characteristics. Consumers also have a
   general preference for variety in the diet, related to the willingness
   of most of the participants to try new foods. Consumers also have a
   preference for freshness. As most of the participants spend most of
   their time outside their home, food shopping tends to be done daily.
   Because generally fast food products are consumed right away there is
   no need for storage or preservation, therefore, products are always
   purchased extremely fresh. When eating alone or in small groups, there
   is a tendency to eat Western fast foods, many of which are perceived as
   requiring less time and effort. Eating in restaurants and/or eating
   Indian-style foods seem to be preferred in situations involving larger
   groups (during lunch/dinner).

   There are two reasons for this: cooking at home for large groups
   requires too much time and effort; and Indian style meals involve the
   sharing of many dishes among everyone at the table. The variety that
   results from this practice is greater with larger groups of people. The
   adoption of Western fast foods is related to the influence of
   significant others, such as family members, the education system
   (hygienic/unhygienic), mass media and co-workers. Social influences may
   encourage or discourage the adoption of Western fast foods.

   Seniors are generally less likely to adopt Western fast food
   consumption behaviors (home cooked food is generally preferred by
   elderly people). The role of mass media in the adoption of Western fast
   foods is primarily to create awareness of the existence of various food
   products, and to provide information. In-store samples of products are
   useful in providing the trial of novel foods. However, attitudes
   towards Western foods are formed more through word-of-mouth and to some
   extent through personal experience and messages of the media.

   Several factors were found to motivate the retention of Western fast
   foods. Perhaps the strongest factor affecting the use of Western fast
   foods is Indian traditions. Foods whose qualities conflict with the
   sensory characteristics of traditional Indian foods are generally tried
   more reluctantly. Western foods are perceived to be having ingredients
   made from beef and pork (tallow) by some of the consumers. In India cow
   is sacred to the Hindus and Pork to the Muslims. Price is also an
   important consideration when making consumption decisions. Low prices
   may induce the trial of some Western fast foods and may allow a Western
   product to be chosen over a similar Indian product.

   However, the people’s love for fast food is reflected in the
   overwhelming number of fast food outlets, whether they are western fast
   food restaurants, local fast food restaurants, snack shops or street
   stalls/kiosks.

   CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
   5.1 Introduction to Conclusion:
   In the course of carrying out the research study, very important
   aspects have emerged. Despite being the city having highest per capita
   income and competing in every aspect with a well-developed western
   town, the results show an astounding difference between the consumption
   behavior of the western consumers and urban Indian consumers. Below
   listed are the preferences of consumers in Chandigarh for Western fast
   food offerings:

   5.1.1 General:
   The food market in Chandigarh is a large market, which offers
   opportunities for overseas suppliers and producers as a significant
   number of fast food products are in big demand. Chandigarh has a
   population of 6.5 million, comprising mostly of domestic households.

   Shopping and eating habits of domestic households generally reflect
   Indian customs and local circumstances. But, at the same time people
   love to associate themselves with the western culture. Gender roles are
   now changing. Females have started working outside. So, they have no
   time for their home, especially for cooking food. Fast food is an easy
   way out because these are easily available and are convenient/easy to
   eat. Larger families often dine out at dinnertime, and most working
   people dine out at lunchtime.

   Awareness of Western fast food products among Hong Kong consumers is
   high. On average shoppers mention 3.8 Western fast food products
   (un-prompted), when asked. Fresh pizzas, burgers, hot-dogs, French
   fries and sandwiches are mentioned most.

   Local fast food restaurants are the main outlets for fresh food
   products, especially among elderly grocery shoppers. However, as
   younger generations tend to adopt a more Western lifestyle, Western
   fast food outlets are enjoying an increasing share of the market.

   The market for western fast food products is a highly competitive
   market in Chandigarh, due to its free and open nature. Fast food chains
   are originating from all over the world, but the dominant fast food
   chains are from the U.S. Due to the ambience and better service
   conditions, local fast food outlets are preferred by the elderly
   consumers.

   5.1.2 Who are the Consumers of Western fast food products:
   Western food products are mostly bought by consumers in the younger age
   group or are bought on behalf of them by family members/older relatives
   in the same household. The maximum number of consumers of Western fast
   food products are from the age group of 15-25 years, and from the
   household income perspective, most of the consumers are from the
   average income group (Rs.15, 000 to Rs.25, 000; 34%). Consumers are
   relatively open to try out new products and tastes. Differences in age
   and income are important determinants of attitudes and preferences
   towards Western fast food products.

   Hamburgers:
   Purchase frequency of hamburgers is higher in younger consumers (15-25
   years) and it keeps decreasing with the increase in age. Higher income
   people (Rs.45, 000 &amp; above) less often consume hamburgers (15%),
   instead they buy for their children. However, 22% of the average income
   (Rs. 15-25, 000) people eat them 3-4 times a week, while most other
   people buy them only once or twice a month. On an average there is no
   much difference in the consumption of hamburgers for male and female
   consumers.

   Pizzas:
   For the consumption of pizzas the level of income and sex ratio has a
   major impact on the purchase penetration rate. Purchase frequency of
   pizzas is higher in the income group of Rs.15, 000-25, 000. Higher
   income consumers (Rs.45, 000 &amp; above) less often buy pizzas (27%). The
   penetration is much higher under the younger buyers than under older
   buyers. Female consumers are more health conscious and therefore, their
   purchase penetration is lower than male consumers.

   Sandwiches:
   There is no significant difference for the purchase frequency of
   sandwiches when considering the age factor of the consumers, and the
   frequency of buying the sandwiches is higher both in males as well as
   females. Purchase frequency of sandwiches is higher in the income group
   of Rs.10,000-15,000; 89%. However it is noted that higher income people
   (Rs.40, 000 &amp; above) less often buy sandwiches (11%) instead they buy
   for their children.

   5.1.3 How consumers become acquainted with Western fast food products:
   The influence of western culture through media or recommendation from
   relatives or close friends is an important factor of how people get
   acquainted with Western fast food products. Another important way for
   consumers to learn about Western fast foods is dining out in one of the
   many Western restaurants. Especially fast food chains as McDonalds and
   Pizza Hut are well known by consumers. Other important direct triggers
   are advertising, in-store promotions in fast food outlets such as Happy
   meals, free gifts for kids and so on.

   Hamburgers:
   Consumers became acquainted with hamburgers by:
   -Commercial sources, such as, advertising, in-store promotions,
   restaurants (56%)
   – Personal sources, such as family, friends, neighbors, acquaintances
   (19%).
   -15% learned by their experience to try hamburgers out of curiosity.

   Pizzas:
   Consumers became acquainted with pizzas by:
   – Personal sources, such as, family, friends, neighbors, acquaintances
   (42%)
   – Commercial sources, such as advertising, in-store promotions,
   restaurants (38 %)
   Sandwiches:
   Shoppers became acquainted with sandwiches by:
   -Personal sources (39%), such as, family, friends, neighbors,
   acquaintances and 26 % learned by their experience to try sandwiches
   out of curiosity.
   – Advertising, in-store promotions (20%)

   5.1.4 What are consumers looking for in Western fast food products:
     * Generally, Western fast food products are preferred above local
       fast food products for the following reasons:
       – Freshness – Better/durable packaging
       – Better quality – Easy and quick to consume
       – Clean and hygienic – Variety in offerings
       – Better sales service – Better nutritional value
     * Consumers think that the price of Western fast food products is
       higher than the price of local foods, but they are willing to pay
       more for quality and service. Average and higher income shoppers
       are more aware of the price differences, because they buy it more
       often. However, 49% of the respondents mention that Western food
       products are too expensive. Younger people mention more often than
       older people that price is a limiting factor when buying Western
       food products, because they buy them more often.
     * Taste appears to be strength and a weakness for different products.
       49% of all respondents, regardless of gender, age or income; rate
       taste as the most important factor why they like Western fast food
       products. However, when inquiring the dislikes towards Western food
       products, price and ‘unhealthy to eat’ are rated by most of the
       participants as the main ‘dislike’. Younger people like Western
       fast food products more because of its taste, convenience (easy to
       eat) and quality. Higher income shoppers like Western fast food
       products more because of its taste, quality, its appearance and
       packaging. However, most of the female consumers dislike the
       offerings because of its higher price.
     * Purchasing a branded product is considered important when choosing
       Western fast food products. Consumers associate these with the
       general image of the company as a guarantee for the quality, safety
       and hygiene of the product sold by that company. Well-known brands
       are perceived as more reliable than less well-known brands; whether
       it is a foreign brand or a local brand, doesn’t makes a big
       difference to the consumers.
       Hamburgers:
     * Western hamburgers are mainly bought in Western fast food outlets.
       Convenient/easy to eat, ‘children like it’ and taste are the most
       important reasons for buying hamburgers. Female and older buyers
       rate taste and freshness as the most important motive for buying
       hamburgers. The other most important reason to buy hamburger is
       that hamburgers are considered as a snack food, which is rated high
       by both the younger and higher income buyers.
     * Generally, brands are not important when buying hamburgers. Younger
       people find brand name even less important than the average
       consumer. However, 55% of the hamburger buyers find it important to
       have some visual cues on the packaging, especially female and
       higher income hamburger buyers. The country of origin is important
       to most consumers.
     * Most hamburger buyers consume hamburgers right away and eat them as
       a snack; especially younger hamburger buyers. Lower income
       hamburger buyers tend to eat them as part of their meal. The most
       important products preferred in combination with the hamburgers are
       beverages, ketchup, and salads. When hamburgers are not available,
       some buyers would buy any kind of fast food product, whether
       western or local, as an alternative, while others would end up not
       buying anything at all.
     * The number of people who intend to buy less or same number of
       hamburgers this year is larger than the number of consumers who
       intend to buy more. If intend to buy less, reasons to buy less are
       that buyers feel the hamburgers are: (1) expensive, (2) lack in
       nutritional benefits, (3) freshness. If intend to buy more, reasons
       to buy more are that buyers like the (1) taste, (2) quality, (3)
       children like it and (4) convenient (easy to eat).

   Pizzas:
     * 53% of the consumers buy pizzas 1-2 times per week and purchase
       frequency of pizzas is higher in the income group of Rs.15, 000-25,
       000. Pizzas are mainly bought in Western fast food outlets. Taste
       is the most important reason for buying pizzas. Taste and having
       too much caloric value are also the most important reasons people
       less often buy pizzas. The second most important reason to buy
       pizzas is convenient/easy to eat, which is rated by younger buyers
       as the most important reason.
     * Most of the pizza buyers find the brand name neither important/nor
       unimportant, whereas female buyers rate brand name as important.
       About 42% of all pizza buyers find it important to see visual cues
       on the packaging, but they are not interested in the country of
       origin.
     * Most pizza buyers eat pizzas as a snack. This can be attributed to
       the fact that most of the population in the city of Chandigarh
       spends most of their time outside their home. Most of the lower
       income buyers (Rs.10, 000 to Rs.15, 000; 89%) eat pizza as a meal.
       75% of male buyers eat pizza as a snack while 83% of female buyers
       prefer pizzas as a meal. However, female consumers like to share
       the pizzas with others and maximum number of them buy for children.
       Most of the younger consumers like to eat the pizzas right away.
     * Most buyers would not buy another substitute in case of
       unavailability of a pizza, although 79% of the younger buyers
       (15yrs. to 25yrs.) would prefer any kind of Western fast food as an
       alternative to pizzas. The most important products preferred in
       combination with the pizzas are beverages, ketchup, dip sauce and
       salads.
     * For the next year, the number of consumers who intend to buy fewer
       pizzas is larger than the number of consumers who intend to buy
       more. If intend to buy less the most important reason are: (1) not
       healthy, (2) expensive. The most important reasons to buy more are:
       (1) Convenient/easy to eat, (2) as a snack, (3) children like it
       (4) freshness. The number of female buyers who intend to buy fewer
       pizzas next year is larger than the number of male buyers. This can
       again be attributed to the health consciousness among females.

   Sandwiches:
     * Purchase frequency of sandwiches is higher in the income group of
       Rs.10, 000-15,000; 89%, and they are mainly bought in snack shops.
       The most important reasons for buying are (1) as a snack, (2)
       convenient/easy to eat. The second most important reason to buy
       sandwiches is freshness, which is rated by most of the female
       buyers and older consumers as the most important reason. ‘Lack of
       freshness’ is also the most important reason people never buy
       sandwiches (41%) followed by not very tasty (18%).
     * Almost half of the buyers find the brand name neither important,
       nor unimportant; whereas higher income (Rs.40, 000 &amp; above; 89%),
       female buyers of sandwiches find brand name as important. The most
       important reason being the use of fresh and quality ingredients.
       However, most buyers (39%) find packaging important. Younger
       sandwich buyers mention packaging of sandwiches neither important,
       nor unimportant.
     * If sandwiches would not be available, most buyers would replace
       them by local fast foods. For the next year the number of people
       who intend to buy same/more sandwiches is higher than the number of
       consumers who intend to buy less. If intend to buy more the most
       important reasons are: (1) less caloric/healthy, (2) cheaper as
       compared to the products in the same category, (3) Convenient/easy
       to eat, (4) As a snack, (5) Freshness.

   5.2 Introduction to Recommendations:
   The Fast food industry in India is poised for significant growth over
   the next few decades, particularly in urban India. Gaining local
   acceptance and blending in to the Indian culture still remains a
   challenge for many fast food restaurants. The study was undertaken with
   an objective to understand the preferences of consumers in Chandigarh
   on Western fast food offerings and based on the results of the study
   the main objective was to identify factors to be considered to
   encourage buying of western fast food offerings.
   Following are some of the recommendations that can be adopted by
   various brands to encourage the buying of Western fast food products.

   India’s fast food industry is growing by 40% a year and is expected to
   generate a billion dollars in sales by 2006. Marketing of fast food and
   getting a foothold in India is going to be highly competitive in the
   near future because of the high potential of the Indian processed food
   sector. On an average, each household spends about 50% of income on
   food and beverages. Following factors should be considered to encourage
   purchasing of Western fast food products:
     * Price appears to be a critical factor in the choice making process
       of consumers, especially younger people. A typical Indian is price
       sensitive because of his modest disposable income and he has
       comparable options in local food. Globally fast food chains only
       succeed when they bring their prices down to the same level as the
       street food. The trick can be to make the offerings better than the
       local food, and price them competitively. Most of the times this
       becomes impossible, so this can be counterbalanced by concentrating
       more on data base marketing and below-the-line activities and
       special offers.
     * Increasingly, eating out is becoming synonymous with entertainment.
       A clean and well-organized store atmosphere appears to be an
       attractive feature. The trend towards takeaways is also fast
       gaining popularity among Indian consumers. Most of the consumers of
       fast food products are from the younger age group; therefore the
       potential consumers should be enticed with TV spots, children
       parties, gifts for kids, and an ambience that is child and teenager
       friendly. Older consumers prefer to visit local fast food
       restaurants instead of self-service Western style restaurants;
       hence addressing such need can be an added feature. In India,
       social and cultural values have a very strong hold on the people.
       The fast food culture has imposed greatly on the views of
       youngsters and the desire for a large family meal. The marketers
       should focus more on positioning themselves as family restaurants
       highlighting their Indian menus.
     * Curiosity and an overall willingness to try new food and the value
       placed on variety in the diet indicate that Western origin fast
       foods are relatively likely to be tried and eventually accepted
       into the diets of consumers. The marketers should gauge to what
       extent preferences converge between the west and India with respect
       to product category. Fast food outlets should introduce varieties
       of products in order to cater the demands of each and every segment
       of the market. Fusion of Indian flavors with western products can
       be offered to counter competition from local products, and also
       strike a good hybrid culture, which will be highly acceptable to
       the western friendly youth in India. All categories of products
       should be introduced so that people of all age, sex, class, and
       income group can become a customer of manufacturer’s food line.
       Products should be developed and marketed to be compatible with
       Indian flavor principles and cooking methods, taking into
       consideration Indian culture and religious sentiments. An ethical
       sensitivity regarding the social legitimacy of consumer influence
       should be there.
     * Visual cues on packaging and clear labels (i.e. name of food, list
       of ingredients, logos) in stores are important. Most consumers
       prefer products with nutritional and caloric value printed on the
       packaging of the products. Nutritional information should be posted
       in prominent locations and online. Apart from salads, vegetarian
       offerings should be given high priority catering to the demand of
       the potential consumers.
     * The time and effort required to shop for and convenience/ease of
       eating food becomes more important in the decision-making process.
       An increased popularity of easy-to-eat products may therefore be
       anticipated. More take-out products can be added to the present
       variety of offerings. A brand should invest more and concentrate on
       having a more efficient distribution system in par with existing
       global standards. It needs to expand in India in parallel to the
       new trend in fast food chains, setting out tiny outlets such as
       express, takeaway, delivery and small dine-ins by fuel stations, in
       multiplexes and other highly frequently visited locations.

   5.3 Implications for Future Research:
   The following issues are suggested for future research to fill the
   existing research gaps:
     * The research project concerned a pilot project on a limited number
       of individual Western fast food offerings only, which may be
       extended to an envisioned continuous annual research programme. The
       scope and content of the study could be widened if similar research
       is conducted with more different product categories in the market
       having similar conditions.
     * The study was conducted in the city of Chandigarh, where it is
       estimated that consumers spend most of their time outside their
       homes. Therefore, the consumers were interviewed at various fast
       food outlets in the city. The trend towards takeaways and ‘home
       delivery’ is also fast gaining popularity among Indian consumers.
       Therefore, the scope of the study can be extended if questionnaires
       are put forward to consumers at their residences, offices, etc.
       Such a study would be very useful in understanding the preferences
       of consumers for the various offerings, and services (e.g.
       home-delivery service, etc.). It will give a deep insight about
       liking and buying behavior of consumers towards Western fast food
       offerings.
     * More intensive and time bound location specific research efforts
       are needed to get a foothold in a highly competitive fast food
       market like India.

   A Model Of Consumer Decision making Process^34:
   A Model Of Consumer Decision making Process

   According to Dr. Thompson, to arrive at a process of decision making, a
   customer normally follows the above process. When stimuli, often
   information from companies, reach an intended customer the decision and
   evaluation process begins. By a complex interaction between the
   individual and environment factors and the marketing mix the individual
   evaluates the stimuli. On completing the process, the consumer reaches
   a decision on the product or service. Even if the decision is positive
   it does not necessarily mean that consumer will make a purchase.
   Attitudes formed directly are proved to be much more stable and
   foreseeable than indirect formed attitudes like questionnaires. It is
   intention that determines what behavior will the consumer choose^35.

   5 Cultural availability deals with what food products are thought of as
   edible materials by a given culture, e.g. Westerners do not understand
   the Chinese, who bury ducks’ eggs in the ground, so that they start to
   ferment, just as the Chinese cannot understand Westerners, when they
   eat cheese, which they regard as bad milk. Similarly, majority of
   Indians don’t eat beef products because cow is considered sacred in
   Hindu culture.

Nirula’s: The place that introduced Delhi to its fast food culture

   Anushka Goel
   Share this article

   On October 5, Deepak Nirula, the man behind the much-popular food
   chain, Nirula’s, passed away. We celebrate his life and achievements as
   we take you on a trip down memory lane to one of the city’s most iconic
   eatery and ice cream parlour.

   The earliest memory that I have of Nirula’s is its classic red chairs,
   bustling crowds and plates filled with delicious food. Long before
   other international pizza chains entered the Indian market and became
   popular, a Nirula’s pizza is what most of Delhi knew. For me, however,
   the most special memory has been showing my report card as a young
   child of six at the counter, and getting a free Hot Chocolate Fudge –
   their best-selling ice cream – as a reward for my scores.

About Nirula’s

   A post shared by Kanpurwants (@kanpurwants)

   The brand, India’s oldest fast food chain, originated as Hotel India by
   Nirula Brothers, Lakshmi Chand Nirula and Madan Gopal Nirula. They soon
   started to open coffee shops and restaurants, before entering the fast
   food business in the 1970s. In 1977, the first fast food restaurant in
   Delhi was opened by the name of Nirula’s, to which, additions such as a
   pastry shop, hot shoppe and an ice cream parlour were later added.

   The outlet became iconic, offering Western treats such as burgers,
   pizzas, submarines and a lot more, which were introduced by Deepak
   Nirula to the brand, along with its ice cream parlour serving 21
   flavours of the delicious dessert.

   The restaurant chain soon opened new outlets, becoming what was
   probably India’s first – and oldest – fast food restaurant chain. It
   attracted customers from nearby towns, and became a part of several
   experiences and ‘firsts’. Be it movies at Chanakya, first dates,
   proposals, birthday parties or more, Nirula’s was the place for all
   occasions, something Delhiites remember fondly to date. The restaurant
   has now expanded to outlets across India and a few in Nepal, too, with
   plans to only grow further.

Nirula’s – a legacy and so much more

   For those born and brought up in Delhi, especially until the 2000’s
   (before international chains took over), Nirula’s brings with it
   bucketsful of nostalgia. I remember dining there every other month.
   After plates of pizzas and sandwiches, it was always time for some ice
   cream, their 21 Love being one of my all-time favourites back then.

   The restaurant had a way to encourage young scholars to do even better
   at school – and this is probably one of my favourite memories from the
   outlet. Each year, my family and I would head to the Nirula’s outlet in
   Connaught Place, bringing report cards of both my brother and I with
   us. Once we were done with our meal, it was always time for some ice
   cream, but before my parents would order, they would present our report
   cards to the cashier. He would then look at us, smile, stamp the card
   and proceed to hand over our free ice cream sundaes – our prize for
   scoring straight A’s or above 90 per cent marks in school – before my
   father an ice cream (usually pineapple or almond praline) for my
   mother.

   Today, limited food is served at even limited outlets, while the
   Nirula’s ice cream parlours have taken over the city. I have one closer
   home, and their popular flavours, such as almond praline, hot chocolate
   fudge and 21 Love, transport me back to the time I was barely six, with
   a report card in my hand, tasting the free ice creams and roaming
   around carefree.

Pizzas

   Available at all the Hot Shoppe outlets, Nirula’s Pizzas are made fresh
   with veggies, cheese, meat, sauces and more. Be it their Margherita or
   pizzas with toppings, each bite will transport you to your childhood!

Burgers

   Nirula’s also introduced the concept of burgers to Delhi. The popular
   fast food snack is still available at Hot Shoppe outlets, with
   delicious fillings and nostalgic flavours.

Hot Chocolate Fudge

   A post shared by Just Delhiing (@justdelhiing)

   Yes, there are countless brands selling this creamy, warming treat, but
   no one does it like Nirula’s! Their Hot Chocolate Fudge, or HCF, is as
   delicious as it can be. Vanilla ice cream topped with a warm, sticky
   sweet chocolate sauce, covered in nuts that are toasted until golden
   and flavourful – tell me if there’s anything better!

21 Love

   You’ve already seen the name of this flavour multiple times in this
   story, but what exactly is the ice cream? Vanilla, with flakes of
   chocolate through it, making for a basic ice cream that’s been elevated
   to another level. Today, instead of flakes, you’ll find pieces of milk
   chocolate in the ice cream, which are melt-in-the-mouth and simply
   delicious. Oh, and, do try this in a waffle cone to make your ice cream
   experience more indulgent!

Abstract

   India’s impressive economic growth in previous decades and more
   inclusive growth recent years have not only resulted in steadily
   increasing income but it brought socio cultural transformation. In this
   process globalization and increasing urbanization contributed
   immensely. India with rich heritage of foods and recipes had the
   tradition of preparing foods by deep frying in fats. This situation is
   getting complicated by emerging fast food culture in all sections of
   society primarily due to their readily availability, easy to access,
   taste, marketing strategies and cafeteria culture. Therefore it becomes
   imperative to introspect about fast food consumption. There are enough
   scientific evidences in India to substantiate that fast food have
   become integral component of diet in all section of society. High
   consumption of fast food has been reported in school going children and
   this is quite substantial in college and university students - in spite
   of the fact that a significant proportion of population are aware about
   adverse consequences of fast food consumption. Children of pregnant and
   lactating women eating fast foods are more prone to obesity. High fat
   and high sugar diet leads to change in fetal brain reward pathway
   altering food preferences. Fast food consumption is rising in India
   across all income categories and this is contributing significantly to
   rising trend of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in this country.
   Regulation of marketing and nutritional labeling is not up to mark in
   India. Growing menace of fast food consumption needs to be restricted
   by adopting legal, service and education approaches for promoting
   healthy dietary practices.

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods

   Nothing can possibly make you ready for the diversity of India’s
   culture, let alone its cuisine. From India’s delectable main-courses to
   desserts to street foods—the options are plenty and very palatable. So,
   hop on to this culinary ride across the 29 states of India where we
   take you through 29 lip-smacking street foods that will leave you
   wanting more.

1) Idli and Punugulu from Andhra Pradesh

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © hungerlunger.in

   Punugulu is essentially made with Idli/Dosa batter and is a deep fried
   snack that’s as crunchy from outside as it’s soft from inside.  Onions,
   coriander and a little yogurt is mixed with the batter to make the
   crunchy balls. These crispy fritters are one of the most popular street
   snacks of AP and are mostly served with an assortment of chutneys.

2) Thukpa from Arunachal Pradesh

   You remember the episode of FRIENDS where Joey messed up his audition
   because he couldn’t say ‘Hmmmm…soup’ and instead kept on saying ‘Noodle
   Soup’. Well, little did he know that he was unknowingly mentioning
   Thukpa because that’s what it is as a whole—noodle soup! A bit spicy, a
   bit hot—it’s made from vegetables and meat and is an ideal supper to
   beat the cold weather.

3) Laksa from Assam

   There’s more to Assam than its splendid tea gardens and picturesque
   locales—and that is its street foods. The most popular one being
   Laksa—which is basically a Malaysian version of spicy noodle soup. It
   consists of the signature Laksa noodles or rice vermicelli cooked in
   tamarind-based fish paste. There are, however, different variants of
   this street food.

4) Litti Chokha from Bihar

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India

   Litti Chokha is to Bihar, what Dal Baati Choorma is to Rajasthan. It’s
   ingenious; it’s ridiculously delicious and is so popular, it’s also
   making its presence known internationally.  The outer crust is made
   from wheat and yogurt whereas the filling is made from Sattu and is
   primarily eaten with ‘Brinjal Bharta’ or mashed potatoes.

5) Faraa from Chhattisgarh

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © noneecooks.files.wordpress.com

   The steamed dumplings of the north eastern region are known as momos
   whereas in Chhattisgarh, it’s called Faraa (phara). The only difference
   being that this popular snack is made from rice. The dish is seemingly
   easy to make but the dough, which is extremely delicate, becomes a tad
   tough to handle.  Served with green chutney, the delectable taste of
   the dish is totally worth it in the end.

6) Chorizo Pao from Goa

   Chorizo is a type of a spicy pork sausage, so, needless to say this
   dish is only for pork-eating non-vegetarians. But, if you’re in Goa now
   or anytime later, do try this finger-licking good delicacy. Apart from
   adding some spices and herbs, this dish is eaten with soft bread (pao).
   Yummers all the way!

7) Dabeli from Gujarat

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India

   Dabeli is the desi version of American burger where tangy potato mash
   is sandwiched between buns, top-laced with pomegranate, onion and sev.
   It’s mostly served with garlic chutney but always tastes heavenly.

8) Dahi Samosa from Haryana

   This tangy, sweet chat dish is a popular roadside snack of Haryana.
   Greased and golden friend samosas with onion and potato filling are
   broken down into chunks, and are then laced with copious amounts of
   sweet curd, green and tamarind chutney. Enough said!

9) Sidu from Himachal Pradesh

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India

   Sidu is a kind of a yeast-induced soft bread which is made of wheat
   flour and eaten with either desi ghee, dal or meat curry. A must try!

10) Kalari Kulcha from Jammu and Kashmir

   This rather famous kulcha of Kashmir is made from Kalari cheese (which
   is known as Maish Krej) and thus the name! It’s a round baker’s bread
   split open and warmed on a flat surface, topped with onions, tomatoes
   and cheese, of course. This cheese is so heavenly and is found only in
   J&amp;K; in fact, it’s actually J&amp;K’s best kept secret yet.

11) Barra from Jharkhand

   Barra or bara is a traditional delicacy made of tablets of thick rough
   dough of grams (dal or even rice) and is filled with grated onions and
   chillies. One of the easier dishes of Jharkand to make.

12) Banana Buns from Karnataka

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © mypinchofyum.files.wordpress.com

   Of course, the idlis, dosas and uttapam are very much a part of
   Karnataka’s street food culture, but there is something more exotic and
   sumptuous about the Mangalore-based banana buns of Karnataka. Unlike
   the regular baked buns, banana buns are made solely out of mashed
   banana mixture and flour which is then kneaded to dough and fermented
   for a few hours. They are mildly sweet but go very well with spicy
   chutney.

13) Parippu Vadu from Kerala

   Parippu Vadu, or more commonly recognized as dal vada, is a crunchy and
   spicy evening appetizer which is mostly served alongside tea. In fact,
   eating tea with those yummy vadas on a beautiful rainy day makes for
   #lifegoals.

14) Pohe-Jalebi from Madhya Pradesh

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © 4.bp.blogspot.com

   The combination may sound bizarre but it’s actually MP’s (or Indore
   specifically) most sought-after street food. Served in breakfast along
   with sev and nukti, this specialty from heart of India can’t be missed!

15) Keema Pao from Maharashtra

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © www.factsdose.com

   Before you chastise me for not mentioning the beloved ‘Vada Pao’, hear
   me out! Vada Pao is not just a street food of Maharashtra, it’s an
   emotion which not only Indians, but even the world is familiar with
   now. So, it’s only fair to give a fair chance to another equally tasty,
   if not more, street food which is keema pao—minced meat with buttered
   bread. Salivating already?

16) Kelli Chana from Manipur

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © www.factsdose.com

   A delightful and a rather filling snack found on the streets of the
   beautiful Manipur, it used to be made with chickpeas originally but is
   now made from the spicy yellow peas and served on a lotus leaf. The
   aroma of the leaf is said to enhance the taste of the dish.

17) Kappa from Meghalaya

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © 4.bp.blogspot.com

   A local delicacy which is made from chicken entrails cooked with
   cooking soda and boiled with fresh garden spices. Kappa is a hot dish
   which is perfect for the dewy weather of Meghalaya. It’s an acquired
   taste, but once you get used to this dish—it’s straight out heaven on
   your platter.

18) Arsa Buhchiar from Mizoram

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © indianfoodfreak.com

   The food of Mizoram is quite similar to that of other north eastern
   states, generally mild with lots of vegetables and meat. Arsa Buhchiar,
   which is mainly a chicken pudding, is no different! It is a kind of
   special rice made with chicken and veggies and a must, must have.

19) Kinalas from Nagaland

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © 2.bp.blogspot.com

   This popular noodle dish of Nagaland is comfort food at its best. The
   broth is made from either beef or pork head (well yes!) that is
   tenderly boiled and the soup is topped with a brown sauce. Yummy in
   your tummy!

20) Guguni from Orissa

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © journeyingjames.com

   An accompaniment to most evening tea time snacks, guguni is a delicious
   snack which is mildly spicy when made at home, but roadside vendors
   tend to be a little more generous with spices. Black gram or yellow
   peas is cooked in traditional eastern Indian gravy and mostly served
   with puffed rice (moori) on the roads.

21) Chole Bhature from Punjab

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India

   Chole Bhature is popular not only in Punjab, but all over India. Made
   with white chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, chillies and other Indian
   spices, the curry is then enjoyed with deep friend Indian flatbread.
   This is one dish that will make both you and your taste-buds happy.

22) Pyaaz Kachoris from Rajasthan

   This delectable dish originated in Jodhpur but is now popular
   throughout Rajasthan. The crispy and flaky kachoris are deep-fried
   until they’re golden brown and then stuffed with a rather appetizing
   onion filling and served with a tangy tamarind chutney. Need we say
   more?

23) Momos from Sikkim

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India

   Momos hands down remain unbeatable when it comes to the most popular
   dish of the seven sisters.  Eaten enthusiastically all over India, it’s
   Tibetan steamed dumplings stuffed with minced meat or veggies and eaten
   with a fiery tomato chutney or along with Thukpa.

24) Kottu Parotta from Tamil Nadu

   Kottu Parotta finds its origin in Sri Lanka where it’s called Kothu
   Roti. It’s basically prepared with mixed vegetables (including carrots,
   peas and beans), or with scrambled eggs or with chicken pieces
   depending on what you want. Served with a signature gravy (known as
   Salna gravy).

   © media3.sailusfood.com

   As the name suggests, this pork delicacy is made out of boiled pork
   pieces which are then mixed with onions, ginger, chilly, salt and a
   specific kind of plant leaf. It’s definitely my favourite in the list!

27) Aloo Tikki Chaat from Uttar Pradesh

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © ecx.images-amazon.com

   One of the most mouth-watering street dishes of India and especially in
   Uttar Pradesh, Aloo Tikki Chaat is enjoyed by both vegetarians and
   non-vegetarians alike. Hot and crunchy potato cutlets straight off the
   pan, broken into tiny pieces and mixed with tangy green and tamarind
   chutney and topped with sev and onions is what dreams are made of!

28) Aloo ke Gutke from Uttarakhand

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India

   A popular Kumaoni dish of potato cubes fried in mustard oil and
   seasoned with red chilles, coriander and eaten with hot piping tea.
   Tempted, aren’t you?

   Lip-Smacking Street Foods From Different States Of India
   © s3.amazonaws.com

   Kolkata’s authentic Jhalmuri is a tangy, spicy, crispy albeit healthy
   popular street snack of West Bengal. It’s actually a cousin of the
   famous Bhel Puri of Maharashtra—the only difference being it doesn’t
   have a sweet chutney and is made out of mustard oil. It’s also a
   delightful tea-time snack!

A BITE-SIZED HISTORY OF INDIAN STREET FOOD

   Contested, colourful and different depending on who you ask,
   practically every Indian street snack has its own fascinating origin
   story. In fact, the history of Indian street treats is as varied as the
   spices used to flavour them. There’s pav bhaji, a bread and curry combo
   said to have originated in the mid-1800s as a midnight dinner for
   Mumbai’s factory workers. Vendors, one story claims, would mash up the
   day’s leftover veggies, add some spices and sell the resulting curry to
   workers heading home from the nightshift. Or there’s the country’s
   favourite sweet, the jalebi, which was brought to India during the
   middle ages by Persian traders, the Hindu name for the treat a
   corruption of the Arabic ‘zalabiya’.

   Diverse and diverging histories aside, street food remains at the heart
   of contemporary Indian life. Street stalls provide sustenance for
   labourers and students who can’t afford to eat in more formal eateries,
   a convenient lunch spot for busy office workers and employment for
   over ten million people who make their living selling food and other
   goods on the street.

THE MANY VARIETIES OF INDIAN STREET FOOD

   With so many mouthwatering options on offer, deciding what to eat on an
   Indian street food adventure can be an anxiety-inducing affair. To help
   you spend less time deliberating and more time stuffing your face,
   we’ve rounded up ten of the best gustatory delights the Indian streets
   have to offer. Go forth and feast.

EATING ETIQUETTE

   The main rule for eating Indian food — on the street or otherwise — is
   to forget all you’ve been taught about eating with your hands. Here,
   it’s not rude to touch your food; it’s expected. Said to improve
   awareness of taste, eating with your hands is also meant to create a
   connection with your meal that nurtures the mind and spirit as well as
   the body. But eating with your hands isn’t a free pass to throw all
   etiquette out the window. Utensil-free dining in India comes with its
   own set of norms — always wash your paws throughly before and after a
   meal, and most importantly, remember to use only your right hand for
   eating; your left hand shouldn’t make any contact with the food. Also,
   try to be a little delicate about getting those tasty morsels into your
   mouth — you’re expected to push the food in discreetly with your thumb,
   not shove all your fingers in.

A PERFECT COMBINATION

   These savoury and often spicy snacks from India are best washed down
   with a brew — ice cold, of course. Little Creatures Pilsner will quench
   any thirst left from spicy aloo tikki and buttery vada pav, while Hahn
   SuperDry delivers a crisp, dry taste matched well with white meat, an
   ideal mate for a kati roll. And to round it all out, James Squire One
   Fifty Lashes pale ale is the perfect pair for hot, complex flavours.
   Plus with its fruity nose and clean finish, the beer also goes down a
   treat with a little bit of sweet.

Short History of Street Food. Love for Indian Street Food at Indico

   5 May 2017

   Street food consists of readymade food items that are sold by a vendor
   in markets or open places. They may include the solid food items,
   various drinks or juices. Street food has become a very important
   business nowadays. And people have always admired and loved street food
   and street food markets.
   You walk across the street and you will see many vendors selling the
   food items. These are the delicious, traditional food items. They have
   a unique aroma and flavor attached with them that makes every passer-by
   to stand, and taste it. Moreover, they are readily made within a short
   duration of few minutes. This adds to its specialty of giving a try to
   these food items. According to a report of FAO (Food and Agriculture
   organization) there are around 2.5 million people who tend to eat
   street food daily. That is to say, the number of consumers of ‘street
   food’ is increasing day by day.


History

   Every culture and region has a history that shows the love of people
   for street food. It dates back to the ancient Greece time period. They
   used to serve fried fish as their most common street dish. For people
   of ancient Rome street food was their main source of food. The
   ‘chickpea soup’ was a commonly sold item. China has a similar history.
   During colonial time of America, the vendors used to sell ‘roasted
   oysters and corn’. Oysters remained as a popular street dish due to its
   cheap price and delicious taste till 1910. After that there came a
   little set back to it. New York had a bit different history. The
   government put many restrictions on vendors and then actually
   completely banned this business by 1707. In Africa, many women and
   children get their earnings from selling street meals. Another example,
   during 19th century in Transylvania, vendors used to sell ‘ginger
   bread’ and ‘corn mixed with cream’ on the streets. ‘French fries’
   emerged in Paris as the most selling street meal by 1840. In Thailand,
   initially this business couldn’t gain much popularity. In Japan, street
   food business started 100 years back where it was provided to students
   and laborers.


Advantages of street food

   There are certain advantages of street food that has contributed to its
   popularity worldwide, such as:
   • It is easily available on the streets. Hence you can easily buy them
   without making an extra effort to go to a far place for food
   • The taste is delicious and unique
   • It often includes the traditional food items that you may have a
   problem looking for in big restaurants
   • They are made from traditionally old recipes, preserving the original
   taste of these food items too
   • They are cheaper in price
   • Preparation is in front of customers so one gets good idea of the
   ingredients included in them.


Difference between street food and fast food

   A strong association between street food and fast food is often
   created. But this is entirely wrong. They can only be linked in the
   sense that both are readily available. You don’t have to wait extra
   time for it to get prepared. But there is a huge difference in their
   preparation methods and qualities.
   • Fast food is a processed food. Its preparation includes using lots of
   preservatives and chemical compounds. Fast food companies spend lots of
   money for preserving the texture and flavor of their food items with
   the use of these chemical additives. Whereas the street food is fresh
   and pure, just like homemade food, free from all sorts of
   preservatives.
   • Chefs and vendors prepare the street food in front of the customers.
   So the customer knows the ingredients of the food items. On the other
   hand in fast food, a person is totally oblivion of right ingredients
   • Street food consists of traditional dishes of that area. This is not
   the case with fast food.


Love of Street food in India

   The street food business in India has flourished to a vast extent.
   Indeed, many people love to eat it. The street food contains a vast
   variety of food items that are available to people in the form of meat,
   vegetables, chicken, cheese products etc.
   Moreover, Indian food is one of the most popular foods worldwide. They
   have a very diverse range of savors. They have quite a large range of
   spices admixed with food, giving a unique taste to every food item.
   There are large amount of street food items in India that you can try,
   such as paratha’s, gol gappas, tandoori chicken, kahthi rolls, bheil
   puri, aloo tikki, pakoras, samosas, kebabs, etc. They keep a long
   lasting delicious flavor on the taste buds.

Why is Street Food Loved Around the World?

   [g3LuLyDGtK.jpg]

   Ask any food lover who loves to eat at a roadside food stall as to why
   they're so fond of street food? We bet, you won't just get a single
   reason, because there are so many reasons behind the cravings for
   street food throughout the world. To name some:
     * Street foods are the cheapest. For people who don't have a
       sufficient income, people who are bored of eating a home-cooked
       meal, unemployed people, Indian street food comes as a blessing for
       everyone. No matter who you are or what your financial status is,
       street food is something that fits everyone's pockets.
     * Many times when you walk on the road, the smell of some roadside
       dish hits you, and you decide to stop and have a plate of your
       favourite food item. And even if you're full, you still choose to
       have it, because there's always a particular space reserved for
       such mouth-watering food.
     * Ever observed the people who eat roadside food? If you did, then
       you must be aware of the way they eat - some are slurping, some are
       licking their fingers, some are just busy smelling the food before
       they finally decide to eat. This is why most people love eating at
       the roadside. It feels great to eat the way you want to, to eat
       like a hungry animal and still not get judged. Because let's be
       honest, everyone over there does the same thing.
     * Who would doubt the authenticity of this sentence when we say that
       street foods are tasty! You won't find a single food stall across
       the world where people don't enjoy the taste of the food they're
       offered.

The Vast Diversity of Indian Street Food

   [lk4Oztl5Tq.jpg]

   India is a country where you will find diversity in everything. The
   difference in culture, diversity in languages spoken, a variety of
   people, and diversity in food as well. Every Indian state, every Indian
   city has its speciality when it comes to street food. Can you roam the
   streets of Indore without having the mouth-watering 'Poha and Jalebi'
   which is the finest street food and speciality of Indore? Can you walk
   through the busy and crowded lanes of Mumbai without grasping a
   'Vadapav'? What about the lip-smacking 'Aloo-tikkis' of Lucknow, Uttar
   Pradesh or the most popular 'Idlis and Vada-Sambhar' of Chennai? You
   won't be able to resist the temptation! When it comes to street food,
   no other country can beat India where not just one or two or three, but
   every single state and city has its variety of delicacies.
   Talk about the famous 'Bikaneri-Kachori' of the royal state of
   Rajasthan, India. Bikaner is noted for its amazing cuisines and
   delectable street foods. Not just Bikaneri-Kachori, the desert state is
   also favourite for its famous Dal-Baati Churma and Pakoras. These food
   items can be found in almost every street stall of Bikaner.

What Makes Indian Street Food so Popular

   [TRNhejY0VJ.jpg]

   The popularity of Indian street food can be known from the very fact
   that every day millions of people from different regions prefer to eat
   roadside food from various street vendors. According to our Ancient
   Hindu Dietary rules, there are two concepts when it comes to food -
   Kaccha food and Pakka food. These concepts are still at play even
   today. Kaccha food was traditionally only consumed at home because
   Kaccha food such as rice and dal require certain kind of purifying
   rituals to deliver them safe for people to eat whereas Pakka food items
   can be securely consumed outside one's house. Hence, Indian street
   foods are generally made from the Pakka food items because that's what
   is acceptable amongst most consumers.
   If we take a look at the health and hygiene aspect of Indian street
   food today, it is no more unclean or unhealthy (unless you eat from
   some very rearward area.) You will find that almost every other Indian
   street food vendor uses vegetables, pulses as well as many ayurvedic
   species such as garlic and turmeric. All these healthy ingredients add
   to the richness of street food. Moreover, many street vendors these
   days wear disposable gloves to avoid any health problem.
   Western visitors when in India often try to stay away from roadside
   stalls because they're concerned about the hygiene. But if you ask me,
   Indian street foods are way much healthy, better, and freshly cooked as
   compared to any tourist restaurant cuisine. Unlike restaurants where
   you're not even sure whether the food that you're being served is newly
   prepared or old or might even be leftover food, street vendors
   guarantee you to offer the best and freshly prepared food. It satisfies
   us to see that the food that we're going to eat is cooked right in
   front of our eyes. What can be better than this? The street vendors of
   India make a living out of their stalls, so they'll always make sure to
   satisfy their customers so that the customers visit again. And which is
   why they also make sure that the food is not only tasty but at the same
   time fresh and hygienic. It is why we Indians can proudly say that our
   street foods are the best and the most popular ones.

The Top 10 Street Foods of India

   [n9sSkLLg4P.jpg]

Chole Bhature

   [8D8vyit7OC.jpg]

   Chole bhature is a Punjabi dish that belongs to the northern part of
   the Indian subcontinent. Although Chole Bhature is widely popular in
   Punjab, it is also famous in the urban cities of India. Apart from
   Punjab, Delhi is the best place to have the luscious Chole Bhature. The
   combination of spicy chana masala (Chole) and soft Bhature can make any
   food lover's day. One can find this absolute wealthy treat almost
   everywhere on the streets of Delhi. Paharganj, Kamla Nagar, Sardar
   Bazar are the areas in Delhi where you can enjoy the best piping hot
   plate of Chole bhature.

Momos

   [UqqsNGzZRW.jpg]

   Momos primarily originated from the Tibet. Later the dish spread to the
   neighbouring countries. It is a dish that is quite popular in the
   Northern part of India, Momo is a traditional daintiness for the
   Nepalese and Tibetan communities. One can find different versions of
   Momos in many states and cities of India. But if you want to enjoy the
   authentic taste of Momos, then Northeast India have it best. Go out on
   the streets of Nepal, Ladakh, Jammu, and Tibet, and you can find people
   enjoying the hot steamed dumpling of Momos. The outer cover of a Momo
   is generally made of water and white flour dough. At times a little
   baking soda is added to improve the texture of the dough. Momos are of
   two types - steamed and fried. You can easily find two kind of Momos on
   the streets of Nepal and they are commonly served with a dipping tomato
   sauce.

Ice Gola

   [RJj1uc8cWo.jpg]
   Source ThebetterIndia

   Ice-gola, Barf ka gola, Chuski, you name it! It is believed that the
   Japanese were the ones who invented the Ice-gola. Back in the era of
   794 to 1185 AD ice was considered very rare, and during the Heian
   period, ice would be brought down from mountains and later they used to
   store it in a cave - which translates to ice room. This is what people
   believe to be the story behind the Ice-gola. Whatever the story behind
   the Ice-gola is and whoever invented this refreshing Ice-gola, we owe a
   lot to them. Now, do you ask where one can find the best gola in India?
   It's everywhere! You heard that right, no matter where you belong to in
   India, ice gola is something you can't resist yourself from having.
   Those combined delicious flavours with icy syrups is something people
   long for during summers. Many shops provide some excellently flavoured
   Ice-gola, but nothing is better than having a cold, refreshing Ice-gola
   on the roadside streets while beating the scorching heat and reliving
   those happy childhood days once again.

Dahi Puri

   [pSZBYL52i2.jpg]

   For all the chaat lovers out there, Dahi Puri is a decadent treat for
   them. Dahi Puri is most popular in the state of Maharashtra, India and
   it's believed to be originated from the Mumbai city. Walk into the
   streets of Mumbai, and you will come across numerous street stalls
   offering Dahi Puri along with other famous chats. One gets to eat like
   some 5 or 6 Dahi Puris per plate. Just like Pani puri, each Dahi Puri
   should be eaten whole so that you don't miss the taste of all the
   flavours and textures. It is best enjoyed when it is eaten in one go.

Pav Bhaji and Vada pav

   [D5VJeqoiaV.jpg]

   Mumbaikars have an extraordinary attachment with the 6 ladi or 8 ladi
   pavs. Just utter the word 'pav', and we will introduce you with a wide
   variety of pav dishes. Pav-bhaji and Vada-pav are only the two most
   popular amongst them. Both these dishes originated from Mumbai.
   Do you know there's one fascinating story behind how the pav bhaji was
   introduced? Back then, Mumbai was full of labour class and mills. Due
   to a lot of work, the workers didn't have much time to sit comfortably
   and have their lunch, they used to get very short lunch breaks. At the
   same time, their work demanded that they shouldn't eat anything heavy.
   That is when the roadside vendors arranged the pav bhaji. Interesting!
   Isn't it? Pav bhaji is a thick curry where many vegetables are used
   such as onions, green peas, capsicum, tomatoes, potatoes, cauliflower,
   and many more. It is served with soft pav with deep fried butter.
   Vada pav, the name in itself is enough to brighten the mood of every
   Mumbaikar. This Indian burger is the favourite of everyone. And if you
   ever stepped in Mumbai, you cannot leave without eating the all-time
   favourite Vada pav. There isn't just one best place to eat Vada pada.

Idli, Dosa and Vada

   [Jn7Y6ta99N.jpg]

   Idli, Dosa, and Vada all these dishes originate from the southern part
   of India and they are the most popular mouth-watering delicacies of
   south India. South-Indians love to have these dishes as their
   breakfast. All the three dishes have rice flour batter as their main
   ingredient. When it comes to Dosa, there are two types of dosas. One is
   Masala Dosa where a mixture of vegetables are added on top of the Dosa
   batter and is cooked on a hot pan. And the other is Plain Dosa. Idlis
   and Plain Dosa are served with the coconut chutney while Medu Vada is
   served with hot sambhar.

Aloo Tikki

   Aloo Tikki is another all time favourite snack that is served at the
   roadside stalls all over India. Aloo tikki originated from northern
   India and is made of boiled potatoes with added species. This
   North-Indian snack is served hot with sauce. Every city has a different
   name for Aloo tikki. For example, in Mumbai it's called Ragda Patties
   and is sold at various chaat stalls. Aloo tikki in Mumbai is popular at
   the Chowpatty Beach.

Meat Rolls and Kulcha

   [JXPmwLSeTq.jpg]

   A Meat-roll or Roulade is a delicious dish which can be found in both
   context of a sweet as well as a savoury. One of the examples of sweet
   Roulade is Swiss role. A meat roll contains part of steak which is then
   rolled with a filling like green veggies, cheese or any other meat.
   Such a dish is locked with the help of toothpick or with a strand of
   fibre.
   Kulcha, on the other hand, is typically a flatbread which is believed
   to originate from the southern region of Asia or the Indian
   subcontinent. The speciality of this dish is that earthen clay oven,
   also known as tandoor is used to bake Kulcha which results in an
   amazing taste. It can be made with many variations like Plain Kulcha or
   nowadays even stuffed ones are very popular, depending upon the liking
   of a person.

Poha

   Did you know, according to nutritionists, poha is one of the healthiest
   Indian breakfasts dishes. Poha is a good source of iron, carbohydrates,
   and essential vitamins. Poha mainly originated from Maharashtra, India.
   In Maharashtra, 'kanda poha', or onion poha, is the most popular one.
   This Indian dish is also prepared in other states of India such as
   Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana. You can't find as
   many stalls of vendors selling poha as that of other famous street
   chaats. But there are areas in Maharashtra where you can enjoy the best
   poha dishes.

Pani Puri

   [USNp55AD1w.jpg]

   This round, hollow, and crunchy puri ranks on the top list of every
   street food lover. Different regions have different names for
   pani-puri. In Madhya Pradesh it is called fulki, paani-patashi in
   Haryana, gol-gappa in Uttar Pradesh, pakodi in Gujarat and the list is
   endless.
   It is believed that pani-puri originated from the epic Mahabharata,
   here is the story behind it. When a newly wed Draupadi returned home,
   her mother-in-law Kunti gives her a task to test her capabilities. She
   gave Draupadi a little amount of wheat flour, and some leftover
   potatoes and instructed her to make some food that would satisfy the
   hunger of her sons. It was then that Draupadi invented pani-puri and
   impressed with her daughter-in law's capability, Kunti sanctified the
   dish with immortality. The accuracy of the history is yet to be found
   out though. Whatever the past might be, one thing is clear, and it is
   the fact that all over India, people love pani-puri.

History of Street Food

   Read time: 2 Min
   France, 04th August 2015

            The roots of street food can take us way back into history. It
   is believed that as the first distribution point of street food, small
   fried fish were sold on the streets in ancient Greece. Street food was
   widely consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement
   homes did not have ovens or hearths. In ancient China, where street
   foods generally catered to the poor, wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street foods and bring meals back for their masters to
   eat in their homes. Urbanisation and street food go hand in hand.
   Historically, in places such as ancient Rome, street food was purchased
   because urban poor did not have kitchens in their homes. Across the
   globe, street food, sometimes also synonymous with fast food, has
   become an important part of daily life as local population increasingly
   struggle to keep pace with their hectic lifestyles. The street vendors
   offer hotfresh, lip smacking snacks which are very filling and absolute
   value for money. Take-out food, junk food, snacks, and fast food are
   synonymous with street food and all of these can be purchased on the
   foot path without entering any building. These foods are popular mainly
   because they are easily available, and that too at half the price or
   less of any restaurant food. It is of particular cultural importance to
   India, where this forms the means of livelihood for many pushcart
   vendors, dhaba owners and their families. This street food culture also
   ensures that the connection with India’s rich cultural heritage is
   retained, with influences ranging from the Mughal dynasty to the
   British Empire. According to an estimate of the Food and Agriculture
   Organisation, which was released in 2012, over 2.5 billion people eat
   street food in India every day. The National Street Food Festival,
   which is an annual event organised in Delhi by the National Association
   of Street Food Vendors of India is a platform where street food from
   all the states of the country is showcased. This is a platform which
   showcases the cultural diversity of the country in the culinary space –
   specially catering to street food.

           Today, while some street foods are regional, many are not,
   having spread beyond their region of origin. A lot of people, who have
   not been exposed to the street food culture, shy away from it thinking
   it is unhealthy and unhygienic. However, one would be surprised to
   note, that despite concerns about contamination at street food vendors,
   the incidence of such is low with multiple studies showing rates
   comparable to restaurants.

            A well-known Australian Culinary Historian and author of the
   recently released ;The Penguin Food Guide to India Charmaine ; Brien,
   who was on a culinary tour to India, observed that the small regional
   food vendors or hawkers across India mostly sold freshly cooked meals
   using fresh ingredients. While elaborating on Indian food cuisine and
   culture, O'Brien said Indian regional food was most complex and offered
   a diverse cuisine unlike known to outside world. “Indian food is laden
   with history, culture, religion, economic conditions as well as
   weather,” she said. Even trade affected the development of Indian
   cuisines, she said adding 'In Madurai, the Chettinad cuisine has
   expensive spices like fennel, coriander, clove, cinnamon which
   reflected that people were wealthy and trade happened.

Why is it taking so long to label fast food?

What are the regulations on salt and trans-fat in junk food, and why is the
FSSAI draft still not law?

   The story so far: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) unveiled
   a new study this week which showed that salt and fat in an array of
   “junk food” was well above proposed regulatory thresholds. The packaged
   and fast foods analysed were chips, savouries, pizzas and burgers that
   are widely available in restaurants and other commercial outlets. This
   is not the first time that the CSE has conducted such research.
   However, the findings are significant as the Food Safety and Standards
   Authority of India (FSSAI) is yet to make into law draft regulations on
   setting limits, and publicising information, about nutrients in fast
   and packaged foods.

How did the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) conduct the study?

   Its Environment Monitoring Laboratory tested salts, fat, trans-fat and
   carbohydrates in 33 foods using 14 samples of chips, savouries, instant
   noodles and instant soup. There were also 19 samples of burger, fries,
   fried chicken, pizza, sandwiches and wraps, sourced from grocery stores
   and fast food outlets in New Delhi. The pizza, burgers, chips and
   snacks to be tested were stored in laboratory conditions and ground to
   a powder or paste. Then they were chemically analysed to determine the
   salt, fat, trans-fat and carbohydrate levels. The aim was to find out
   the levels of these products in actual servings/packets of the foods.

How was it established that these nutrients were above thresholds?

   To calculate this, the organisation relied on the concept of the
   recommended dietary allowance (RDA), a daily ceiling on the amount of
   salt, fat, carbohydrate and trans-fat. The RDA is based on scientific
   consensus and has been agreed upon by expert bodies such as the World
   Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Nutrition
   (NIN), Hyderabad (in India). It says that, ideally, an adult should
   consume no more than 5g of salt, 60g of fat, 300g carbohydrate and 2.2
   g of transfat every day. Further, the RDA from breakfast, lunch and
   dinner should not be more than 25% and that from snacks (assumed to be
   those munched between meals), must be no more than 10%. Thus, a snack
   should ideally have no more than 0.5g of salt and 6g of fat.

What is the law on disclosing nutritional components?

   Current Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling)
   Regulations, 2011 only require companies to disclose energy (kilo
   calories), protein, carbohydrates, total fat, trans-fat and saturated
   fat contained per 100g or per millilitre or per serve. It is not
   intuitively easy, without some mental math, to figure out how much is
   actually contained in your serving. There are also no disclosures on
   high salt content and added sugar, and no compulsion on companies to
   disclose nutritional information on the front of the pack. In 2013, the
   FSSAI, the apex food regulator under the Union Health Ministry, set up
   a committee to regulate packaged snacks. This committee, which
   consisted of doctors, nutrition experts, public policy activists and
   the CSE itself, recommended in 2014 that information on calories,
   sugar, fat, saturated fat and salt be displayed upfront. In 2018, the
   FSSAI came up with a draft law, the Food Safety and Standards
   (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018. The draft recommended that a
   packet should have clear information on how much each nutrient, such as
   salt, sugar, contributed to the RDA. The draft said salt must be
   declared as sodium chloride for instance, and that those ingredients
   which breached the RDA should be marked in ‘red’.

   Food companies had reservations mainly because they felt ‘red’
   signified danger, fearing that this would give consumers the impression
   that they were consuming toxic food. The draft regulations never became
   law. Instead, a third committee was formed, headed by B. Sesikeran, a
   former director of the NIN. Based on this committee’s recommendations,
   a new draft (Draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display)
   Regulations, 2019) was prepared. This replaced sodium chloride with
   salt, total fat with saturated fat and total sugar with added sugar,
   which CSE says, dilutes information on the health harm posed by
   packaged foods. The new draft also exempts beverages less than 80kcal.
   In theory, a beverage can breach “added sugar” RDA without informing
   consumers as long as it is within the energy requirement. The proposed
   law allows companies three years to adjust to the new laws. However,
   the contribution of each individual nutrient to the RDA and whether it
   is breaching safe limits will have to be displayed on the front of the
   package. Though the draft regulations have been out in the public
   domain since July, it is yet to become law. The CSE’s calculations are
   based on recommended nutritional values in the draft versions of these
   laws.

Why is industry opposed to the proposed laws?

   Other than the red labels, the industry says the norms are unscientific
   and that packaged food is made to cater to the “taste” of people.
   Moreover, the packaged industry argues, immense quantities of junk food
   — think samosas or fried food sold on unregulated pushcarts — are
   consumed in the country with no check on their nutritional status and
   there is an inherent unfairness in regulating one section alone.
   Because nutritional information only guides consumers on how to
   regulate their intake, the industry feels people should be advised on
   what makes a healthy diet, the role of exercise and consuming
   appropriate amounts of food. They claim the current regulations only
   contribute to fear-mongering.

Why has not the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) moved on
the draft?

   A top FSSAI official told The Hindu that nearly 700 comments had been
   received on the 2019 draft and there were thorny issues to be resolved.
   To brand packaged food in different colours sends out the message that
   they are unsafe or “toxic”; this would be counterproductive to the
   larger aim of having a regulated but viable packaged food industry and
   people being educated about their food choices. Pawan Kumar Agarwal,
   CEO, FSSAI said he did not agree with the CSE’s analysis and that there
   was still considerable work to be done on establishing appropriate
   “thresholds” (for salt, fat, etc) for India. He said regulation is
   “inevitable” and there would be more scrutiny of nutrient levels but in
   a way that would give packaged food companies time to adapt to stricter
   norms.

What is the practice internationally?

   The CSE says that the proposed labelling regulations publish too many
   numbers and an assortment of colour codes. This could potentially
   confuse people particularly because India has a vast non-English
   speaking population. Chile, for instance, has a system where a black
   hexagon in a white border appears on the front of a package. In the
   hexagon is a phrase that says a product is “high in salt” or “high in
   trans-fat.” The more the hexagons the less desirable the product
   becomes for the consumer; surveys suggest that even children are
   becoming more conscious about the health impact of their favourite
   snacks and often influencing parents’ buying choices. Surveys
   undertaken by the WHO show that a vast majority of European countries
   have some form of front-of-pack labelling, but fewer countries have
   interpretive systems which explain the health factor of foods.

   Street food is an essential part of experiencing a new destination and
   its diverse culture but in India, street food is something more than
   just that. Here, Indian street food is a way of life. Every region,
   state, and even city has its own delicacies that are adored by locals
   that will tell you that the street food in their town is better than
   anything else you might try in India. And they are all right.

   Most Indian street food dishes consist of simple, easy-to-make dishes
   but that doesn’t mean that they won’t explode releasing an array of

   country and taste hundreds of different Indian street food dishes and

Indian Street Food that’s popular around the country

Panipuri

   Where to find it?

   Across India.
   pani puri pani puri

   Pani Puri is one of the most popular street foods on the Indian
   subcontinent. It consists of round flatbreads (called puri) stuffed
   with a mix of chickpeas, onions, potatoes, chutney, chaat masala,
   chutney, and soupy water (pani). The mix of the ingredients, as well as
   the name of the dish varies from state to state. In Uttar Pradesh, this
   dish is known as Golgappa, in West Bengal, Phuchka, in Central India,
   it’s called Gup Chup, etc. Another popular Indian street food that you
   can find in all parts of the country is…

Aloo Chaat

   Where to find it?

   Across India.
   aloo chaat aloo chaat

   This simple potato-based snack is beloved everywhere on the
   subcontinent from Pakistan to Tamil Nadu and from Gujarat to
   Bangladesh. You can find an aloo chaat stall in pretty much every city
   in India. Aloo chaat is made by frying cubed potatoes and adding
   chutney and a myriad of local spices that vary from city to city. It’s
   a perfect snack for any part of the day and is super tasty.

Samosa

   Where to find it?

   Across India.

   Samosa is India’s most popular baked pastry and it’s so popular that
   you can find it in a lot of other places, like Burma, Indonesia,
   Central Asia, and even the southern and western parts of Africa. The
   pastry is stuffed with spiced potatoes, onions, peas, and lentils, and
   it comes in different shapes; triangular, half-moon, and cone,
   depending on the region. This delicious treat also happens to be one of
   the oldest snacks in the world.

Honey chili potato

   Where to find it?

   Across India.

   This crispy-fried spicy potato dish cooked with bell peppers in a sweet
   and spicy sauce is one of the most popular Indo-Chinese snacks and
   appetizers. Honey chili potato originally derives from China but
   India’s version is just as tasty, if not tastier than its Chinese
   counterpart. It’s a perfect beer snack and a great appetizer because
   its perfect mix of sweet and spicy is a great appetite stimulant.

Lassi

   Where to find it?

   Across India.
   lassi lassi

   This refreshing, creamy drink is a mix of yogurt, water, spices, and/or
   fruits. It can be salty or sweet but you can also find different
   versions around India. Not only is lassi super-tasty but it’s also a
   great drink after a spicy meal because it contains a high amount of
   casein, a protein that removes the effects of capsaicin (that chilies
   component that makes you feel like you’re about to turn into a dragon
   and start spitting fire).

Paan

   Where to find it?

   Across India.
   paan indian street food paan indian street food

   This simple snack is a local favorite not only across India but also in
   parts of Southeast Asia as well. Paan consists of an areca nut and
   berries, accompanied by different spices, wrapped in a betel leaf. But
   paan is more than just a snack. A lot of people also use it as a breath
   freshener, palate cleanser (supposedly, it’s great for digestion), and
   some people even use it due to its psychoactive effects. As you’ll see
   below, there are different variations of paan in different parts of
   India.

   Now that we covered some of the street food dishes that are popular in
   all parts of India, let’s see which are some of the most popular street
   food snacks in different regions.

   pretty much anywhere. Chole bhature is a combo of chana masala and hot
   bhatura (fried bread made from maida). The dish is simple to make,
   tastes good, and is super cheap, hence, it’s no surprise that it became
   popular so quickly, especially in Punjab where you can find the best
   chole bhature in India.

Aloo Tikki

   Pretty much anywhere in North and West India, but for the best aloo

   to Manali.

   Sidu is an absolute favorite in Himachal Pradesh and if you try it,
   you’ll soon realize why. This wheat flour bread is the perfect winter
   snack (and winters in Himachal get pretty cold). Siddu is mostly served
   as a side dish but locals like to have it as a snack too. It’s usually
   served with ghee, green chutney, or meat curry.

Kalari Kulcha

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

   Kalari is a tasty local cheese that can be found in Jammu and Kashmir.
   The cheese is sauteed in its own fat and is traditionally made from
   full-fat milk that’s separated using soured milk. Kalari kulcha is a
   round baked bread split open and filled with this cheese. It’s one of
   the most popular snacks in Kashmir but unfortunately, due to the
   isolation of this state, you can’t get it in a lot of other places.

Tunday Kebab

   Where to find it?

   In several different places around India, but for the best tunday
   kebab, head to Lucknow.
   tunde kebab tunde kebab

   Kebabs are probably the most relished non-vegetarian street food dish
   in Uttar Pradesh and the tunday kebab is the best of the best. This
   dish was invented to satisfy the culinary cravings of a dying Mughal
   emperor and was originally made by Haji Murad Ali, a one-handed chef
   which is why this kebab is called tunday kebab (tunde in Hindi means
   one-handed). This is definitely the softest kebab I have ever tried. In
   fact, it’s so soft that it can even give a foodgasm to a toothless
   person.

Aloo Ke Gutke

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Uttarakhand.
   aloo ke gutke aloo ke gutke

   Uttarakhand, this is one dish you absolutely can’t miss.

   to Delhi.

   when combined together make one of the most popular local breakfasts in
   Delhi. The dish consists of a soft puri-like bread made of wheat flour
   filled with dal and a sweet-spicy potato gravy. This seemingly odd mix

   it, you might get addicted.

Daulat Ki Chaat

   Where to find it?

   Mostly in North India, but just like the previous dish, this is also a
   popular Delhi delicacy.

   If nagori halwa bedmi puri is Delhi’s favorite breakfast, then daulat
   ki chaat is probably Delhi’s favorite dessert. Unfortunately, this dish
   ultra-delicious creamy souffle is only available during the winter
   months (November-February). The dessert dish is made of raw milk mixed
   with cream. The mix needs 8-10 hours of cooling before it’s manually
   whisked until it becomes light and frothy. Finally, the milk mix is
   blended with khoya, saffron, and chenna before getting its final form.

Kachori

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in North India, but the dish originates from Uttar Pradesh.

   Kachori is usually made from maida but comes with different feelings in
   different regions with the most common ones being onion, potato, dal,
   and peas. This crunchy, deep-friend treat filled with hot gravy and
   spicy chutneys doesn’t look very appetizing but you’ll change your mind
   as soon as you taste it. After all, this Uttar Pradesh-originated dish
   spread like wildfire due to its unique taste and it’s even famous in
   most of West and East India, and even in parts of South India. In
   places like Rajasthan, there are even different variations of this
   popular dish, such as…

Nasirabaad Ka Kachori

   Where to find it?

   In Nasirabaad, Rajasthan.

   Even though kachoris originate from UP, they’re mega-popular in
   Rajasthan. That’s why, here, you can find a lot of crazy variations
   like the Nasirabaad ka kachori. This dish is the pride of the city of
   Nasirabaad. It’s very similar to the regular kachori but the main
   difference is that this kachori is giant and served with tamarind
   chutney.

   Across India, but the best chicken tikka comes from the place this dish
   originates from- the state of Punjab.

   No list of the best Indian street food can be complete without chicken
   tikka. This ultra-popular street consists of small pieces of grilled
   marinated chicken and it’s served either as a wrap, on a stick, or in a

   the former one being reserved only for religious rituals where fish and

Mishti Doi

   Where to find it?

   In numerous places around India but for the best one, definitely visit
   Kolkata.

   good reason. Mishti doi is prepared by boiling the milk until it
   becomes thick, after which it’s sweetened with sugar and left to
   ferment overnight. The dish is prepared and served in earthenware

   milk. Before trying it, be careful; its sweet and sour taste might make
   you addicted and leave you craving for more.

   Anywhere in Mizoram.

   trying this dish is practically inevitable.

   Anywhere in Nagaland.

   Naga cuisine is all about beef and pork and this stew is a proof of
   that. This juicy broth is made of beef/pork head and other entrails
   enhanced with brown sauce and a bunch of local spices and herbs. I know
   that hearing what the actual ingredients are doesn’t make this dish
   appetizing at all but no trip to Nagaland is complete without at least
   trying kinalas.

Ghugni Chaat

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in West Bengal.
   ghugni chaat recipe ghugni chaat recipe by Notoutofthebox CC by SA 4.0

   rolls.
   indian food indian food

   No trip to Kolkata is complete without trying at least one of the
   city’s mouth-watering rolls. Rolls in Kolkata come in many different
   shapes, sizes, and variations, but the two most popular one are the egg
   roll (a soft bread mixed in a raw egg and filled with onions, chilies,
   cucumbers, and other vegetables spiced up with chaat masala, lime, and

   mustard oil that makes the rice juicier and gives it a nice, pungent
   taste.

Momos

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in India, but you’ll find the best momos in their ‘native
   country’, Sikkim.
   momos indian street food momos indian street food

   There’s a hard debate on the internet over where did momos originate
   from but everyone agrees that this is one of India’s favorite snacks.
   It has been widely accepted around India and north Indians have
   actually mastered the art of momo making to perfection and some of the
   momos in Delhi are almost as good as the ones you’ll get in Sikkim and
   the other northeast states. In case you don’t know what momos are, they
   are a tangy variation of hot dumplings filled with chicken, pork, beef,
   or veggies. Momos come in three variations; steamed, fried, and boiled
   but the most popular version is by far, the steamed one.

Chow Mein

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in India but the best chow mein street food stalls can be
   found in East and Northeast India.
   chow mein indian version chow mein indian version

   I know you might be thinking ‘isn’t chow mein Chinese?’ And yes you’re
   right, chow mein does originate from China. However, if you spent some
   time in India, you’ll know that all foreign food in India is doomed to
   be localized because of Indians’ infinite demands of giving the dish a
   local flavor. That’s why you get a spicy, rich-in onion pizza,
   only-chicken burgers with meat cooked in different kinds of masala,
   etc. A lot of these dishes don’t taste good to most foreigners, but
   chow mein is an exception. Similarly like the momos, the Indian
   rich-in-flavors version of chow mein is different but just as good as
   the original Chinese chow mein.

Thukpa Soup

   Where to find it?

   Mostly in Northeast India but you can also get it in different parts of
   the country.

   Thukpa is actually a Tibetian dish but the thukpa soup you get in
   Northeast India is slightly different but just as tasty. The soup is
   made of long, thick noodles, fresh vegetables, and strong local herbs
   and spices. The best place to try thukpa soup is probably the
   easternmost state in India, Arunachal Pradesh.

Khar

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Assam.

   Khaar is an Assamese dish made from raw papaya, taro, ginger-garlic
   paste, and jackfruit seeds sprinkled with banana peel’s ash extract

   Anywhere in Assam and the neighboring states.
   silkworm stir fry silkworm stir fry

   stir-fry based on silkworm larva as the main ingredient. The larva is

   prime example of this. Chikvi features the unavoidable pork pieces and
   bamboo shoots spiced with turmeric, rice flour paste, raw papayas,
   green chilies, and ginger and garlic pace. If you ever visit Tripura,
   your trip wouldn’t be complete without trying this aromatic dish.

Sanpiau

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Mizoram.

   By now, you’re probably starting to understand the northeastern cuisine
   that mostly relies on rice, bamboo shoots, and local herbs and spices
   which makes northeastern street food a lot more healthy than its
   ‘mainland’ counterparts. Sianpiau is another healthy street food from
   the far northeast. It’s a type of rice porridge spiced up with black
   pepper, fish sauce and coriander paste and topped with spring onions.
   You can get this popular street food in almost every corner of Mizoram.

Litti Chokha

   mashed potato is served with litti and ghee and is enjoyed by locals
   for breakfast, dinner, and lunch.

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Central and West India.
   jalebi jalebi

   If you know a thing or two about street food you’ll inevitably notice
   that this dish combines two seemingly incompatible dishes. Namely, poha
   is a spicy flattened rice dish while jalebi is one of the most popular
   and most sugary sweets you can ever find. It’s one of those dishes that
   you have to be extremely open-minded to try, but if you ever do this,
   you’ll be in for a treat. The mix of sweet and salty makes this dish
   arguably the most contrasting street food India has to offer and
   actually, the primary breakfast choice of most people in Madhya
   Pradesh.

Faraa

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Chhattisgarh.

   Did you ever hear of steamed dumplings made of rice? This intriguing
   mix exists in Chhattisgarh, one of the least visited states in India.
   It looks like a chicken sausage, it feels like a momo, but it tastes
   different than anything you tried before. The recipe is relatively
   short but the dough preparation requires a lot of skill and patience
   which is more than enough to put this dish on the list of best street
   food dishes in India.

Ragi muddle

   Where to find it?

   In parts of Central and South India.

   Ragi muddle is Andhra Pradesh’s favorite staple. The dish consists of

   of ragi, a finger millet, and a muddle which is a moist ball. Ragi has
   been used in these parts of India as a budget alternative of grain for
   ages and throughout the years it became one of the most popular street
   food dishes in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh but a lot of people eat it
   as a full meal too.

Bombay Duck

   Where to find it?

   In Mumbai.
   bombay duck bombay duck

   I know what you might be thinking; duck meat is not very common in
   Indian cuisine. And you’re right. I can’t think of any dishes that
   contain duck meat. The truth is the Bombay duck doesn’t have any duck
   meat in it. It’s made of small strips of deep-fried fish prepared in
   red curry and lightly battered with a crispy exterior while remaining
   soft on the inside. This is one of the best seafood street food dishes
   in India and an absolute must when visiting Mumbai.

Dabeli

   Where to find it?

   In Gujarat, parts of Western India, and Bangalore.

   (Dabeli) but most of them are quite tasty. Dabeli is basically a spicy
   potato sandwich topped with crispy noodles, onions, and spicy peanuts
   served with namkeen. The dish preparation requires a special dabeli
   masala, garlic, and tamarind chutney and a flat barbecue called Tawa.

Bhelpuri

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in West India.

   things but flavors sure isn’t one of them. The dish is a strange mix of
   sweet, salty, and spicy combined in one delicious, 100% vegan snack.
   The dish is usually eaten as an appetizer because nothing can open an
   appetite like its contrast of flavors.

Kanji Vada

   Anywhere Rajasthan and most of West India.
   by Ravi Talwar CC by SA 4.0

   The mix of rai, chilies, and mustard probably doesn’t sound like
   something you would like to have in your drink. But this popular drink
   is actually quite tasty and it also aids digestion (if you happen to
   stuff yourself with too many of the delicious treats on this list). The
   preparation includes a process of fermentation that takes three days
   and adding dal vadas immersed in a mustard flavored kanji can that will
   surely tickle your tastebuds.

   Mistry CC by SA 4.0

   Vada Pav is one of the most popular Indian street food dishes that can
   be found in different parts of the country but it’s not included in the
   ‘’Pan India section’’ because it would to injustice to the meaning vada
   pav has for the city of Mumbai. The day of the average Mumbaikar is
   difficult to imagine without the legendary vada pav, also known as the
   ‘Indian burger’. This mouth-watering burger consists of a bread bun cut
   in half with a deep-fried potato dumpling inside. So simple, yet so

   can’t miss on your trip to Mumbai. This sweet and savory dessert is the
   ultimate sweet combo that combines three of West India’s most popular
   desserts into one. Kulfi is a popular local ice cream, falooda is a
   cold fruit-based dessert, and rabri is a sweet dish made of condensed
   milk. The dessert is topped with vermicelli, pistachios, and almonds.
   If I have one word to describe it, I would use ‘sensational’.

   *I won’t mention these three desserts separately in this list, but do
   try all of them one by one too. They are all amazing!

Ice Gola

   Where to find it?

   In Mumbai.

   Temperatures in Mumbai skyrocket during summers and ice gola vendors
   are a blessing in disguise during these hot summer days. Ice gola is a
   sweet and salty popcycle-like thing that helps you cool down and gain
   some energy for exploring the city. This dessert consists of pieces of

   into a gas that starts coming out of your nose and mouth, making it
   seem like you’re breathing smoke like a dragon.

   deserves a special mention on this list. This lip-smacking deep-fried
   delicacy is made from tapioca or sabudana, peanuts, chilies, potatoes,
   and coriander leaves formed into small patties. Usually, sabudana vada
   is served with yogurt and coconut chutney.

The best South Indian street food

Akki Roti

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Karnataka.
   sadya sadya

   Akki roti is a rice flour flatbread served with coconut or tomato gravy
   and a dressing of carrots, tomatoes, onions, and green chilies that
   give this tasty bread an additional punch of flavors. The dish can only
   be found in the state of Karnataka and is one of the most common local
   staples. As soon as you taste it, you’ll quickly realize why that is
   the case and fall in love with it.

Paddu

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in South India.

   This dish has a lot of different names like appe, paniyaram, and
   ponganalu but they all represent the same thing; a famous South Indian
   street food that tastes a lot like dosa but with a slight hint of
   sourness added in the mix. The batter for these delicious balls is made
   of rice and black lentils and is at its absolute best when combined
   with its best friends- onions, coconut chutney, and tasty filter
   coffee.

Kothu Parotta

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Tamil Nadu.
   south indian street food south indian street food

   Kothu Parotta is a simple but flavorful dish that originates from Tamil
   Nadu but is equally popular in Sri Lanka. The dish consists of minced
   parotta (a flavorful flatbread mixed with pieces of onions, tomatoes,
   eggs, and spices) and a signature salna gravy prepared with either
   chicken or mixed vegetables. Even though it’s not the healthiest dish,
   no trip to Tamil Nadu is complete without trying Kothu Parotta.

Pindi Vantalu (Muruku)

   Where to find it?

   Across South India and Sri Lanka, but the best one can be found in
   Telangana.

   This crunchy South Indian delight is one of the most popular snacks in
   South India and Sri Lanka. It’s made of either moong dal or rice flour
   and has the special power to add textural crunchiness to pretty much
   anything and can be combined with a myriad of other South Indian
   dishes. Everywhere in South India, this treat is known as Muruku but
   Telanganites call it Pindu Vantalu, and in my humble opinion, their
   version tops the charts.

Dal Vada

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in South India.
   vada paav vada paav

   Dal Vada is one of the most beloved street food snacks in South India
   and a lot of people even make it in their homes because the preparation
   is very simple. If you don’t like regular idlis (not for everyone),
   this crunchy variation will surely be a refreshing change. Dal Vada is
   prepared by combining uran, chana dal, moong dal, and tiny slices of
   vegetables, making small balls of the mixture and deep-frying it. This
   dish is usually served with a coconut chutney.

Moong Dal Ladoo

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in South India.

   Moong dal ladoo is an easy-to-make, popular South Indian sweet. These
   delicious, sugary delights are made of the omnipresent moong dal,
   sugar, and ghee. This delicious sweet requires only 3-4 ingredients,
   it’s a rich source of proteins and needs only around 30 minutes to
   prepare which just increases its popularity. The dish is usually
   garnished with grated mooli (radish) and served with a spicy coriander
   chutney.

Dosa

   Where to find it?

   Around India, but needless to say, the best dosas can be found in South
   India.

   Dosa is arguably the most popular snack in South India, in fact, so
   popular that it can be found pretty much anywhere in India. If you
   never heard about it, dosa is a crispy and savory, pancake-like-looking
   dish filled with spicy potato and toppings of your own choice. Dosa is
   an integral part of South Indian cuisine and can be found anywhere from
   street food stalls to fancy restaurants.

Mirchi Bajji

   Where to find it?

   Around South India but for the best mirchi bajji, head to Hyderabad.

   Mirchi Bajji is the South Indian cousin of Rajasthani Mirchi Pakoda
   with a slightly more sour and spicy taste. mirchi bajjis in South India
   are prepared with lime and green chili fritters. The mirchi bajji of
   Hyderabad is notorious for inducing sweat and tears to a lot of
   tourists but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try it. Your visit to
   Hyderabad couldn’t be complete without it.

Idli Sambar

   Where to find it?

   In numerous locations around South India but for the best mirchi bajji,
   head to Chennai.
   idli sambar idli sambar

   Idli Sambar is arguably Chennai’s favorite breakfast and something you
   can find on every corner in the Tamil capital but it’s also very
   popular in other parts of South India too. Idli is basically a rice
   bread dish made of fermented rice and black gram batter steamed in
   molds while sambar is a spicy vegetable curry with lentil base that
   will tickle your stomach and leave you craving for more.

Ram Ladoo

   Where to find it?

   In numerous locations in South India and surprisingly, Delhi.

   (Map link)

   I always refer to Ram Ladoo as the South Indian version of panipuri but
   actually, this is one of the rare South Indian dishes that became one
   of Delhi’s most sought-after street food items. It’s basically a fried
   spicy pakoda served with flavorful moong dal and topped with chilies,
   onions, coriander leaves, and lime juice that offers a burst of
   different flavors that will satisfy every food lover out there.

Idli vada

   Where to find it?

   In numerous locations in South India, but for the best idli vada, you’d
   have to visit Bangalore.
   idli vada idli vada

   If Idli sambar is Chennai’s favorite breakfast, its Bangalore
   counterpart has to be idli vada. As you probably know by now, idlis are
   South India’s popular rice bread steamed in banana leaves while vadas
   are fresh and crispy doughnut-like snack served with spicy hot sambar
   and coconut chutney, making up for one of South India’s most glorious
   combos.

Vellayappam

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in Kerala.

   A list of the best South Indian street food wouldn’t be complete
   without mentioning Kerala’s most famous breakfast- vellayappam. This
   tasty snack is the closest Indian thing that comes to a pancake but the
   preparation steps are slightly different. The batter for vellayappam is
   made of rice flour, coconut, yeast, salt, and sugar. Traditionally,
   this dish is accompanied by one of the local curries but it can also be
   eaten straight up.

Idli chili fry

   Where to find it?

   Anywhere in South India.

   Chili idli fry is a popular snack that’s a rare mix of South Indian and
   Chinese cuisines. The dish consists of South India’s favorite rice
   bread (idli), chilies, and a bunch of optional vegetables. This dish
   quickly rose to popularity because it takes no longer than 10 minutes
   to make it and a lot of people in South India make this from the
   leftovers from yesterday’s lunch. But even if that’s the case, this
   famous street food delight is probably the world’s most tasty ‘leftover
   dish’.

Tips for enjoying street food in India

   Don’t be afraid of Indian street food. There’s always a risk of
   encountering an unhygienic street food stall and getting a bad stomach
   but then again, sometimes, this can happen in famous restaurants too.
   This leads me to my next point…

   Go where the locals are. If you see a long queue of locals in front of
   a street food stall, that’s the best indicator that this particular
   vendor serves not only food that’s safe to eat but also delicious.

   Be careful with street food drinks that aren’t hot. If the water didn’t
   boil, you can never be too sure how the water used to prepare that
   drink will impact your stomach. Just because locals are drinking it
   doesn’t mean it’s 100% safe for you to try it. Their body is used to
   the local water unlike yours.

   Beware of the sauces. Sauces and chutneys are made with tap water most
   of the time. Additionally, some of it might be sitting out in the sun
   for some time but if you follow the above-mentioned tips, you should be
   fine.

   When drinking fresh juice, always make sure it’s juiced in front of you
   and you’re not getting a cup of pre-made juice.

   Now that you’re ready with all these tips, I’m sure you’ll have a great
   time discovering the taste of India through some of its most popular
   street food dishes. Did you try any of these? Which one is your
   favorite Indian street food? Let us know in the comments!

   thank you for the amazing images and info! I cannot find out what my
   favourite snack was called though, can't see it here - I thought it was
   called Padana but googling it didn't work,can you help? It was a batter
   similar to idli but swirled into coils, flat like pancakes but easy to
   tear because the swirl was a spiral and crispy on the edges yet soft
   inside.

   Friday 3rd of June 2022

   Thank you for your comment, Ali, I'm glad you liked it and sorry you
   couldn't find the snack you were looking for. I'm not quite sure but
   from your description it sounds like a dosa variation and there are
   plenty of these variations in South India. Maybe if you search for Dosa
   varieties you'll be able to find what you're looking for. Hope this
   helps.

Why India’s street food vendors are the essence of the country’s food

   I was watching a documentary series on street food. The series had
   various episodes titled after cities in Asia, such as Bangkok, New
   Delhi, Seoul, etc. The episode uncovering New Delhi’s street food
   devotees was my favorite choice, considering my Indian roots. It spoke
   about the backgrounds of the different street vendors serving various
   street dishes. I was taken on a culinary journey across different
   dishes such as the Nihari stew, the Seekh Kebabs, Chaat, and Chole
   Batura. Consequently, the show celebrated the success and continuity of
   the vendors’ lives, businesses, and services to Delhi’s people.
   Ultimately, the documentary thoughtfully represented the enthusiasm and
   success of Indian street food businesses. Essentially, it is important
   to understand that the Indian street food business is an essence of
   flavorsome when it comes to shaping the Indian food market.


   According to cultural Historian Rana Safvi, the concept surrounding
   street food consists of ancient imported roots from the Tomars, the
   Rajputs, the British, and the Mughal empire. Hence, Safvi says that
   when people indulge in infamous street dishes such as the Nihari, or
   the Seekh Kebab, they are also tasting history in the present day.
   Furthermore, Safvi also states that the street food business serves all
   kinds of people – from the working-class category to students – to the
   rich folk – to any common man. Consequently, according to the Program
   Head of the National Association of Street Vendors, Sangeeta Singh,
   “many people don’t seem to have kitchens, and are totally dependent on
   street food for their meals; so if someone has to taste real food,
   authentic food, it has to be street food.”

   Over the years, the street food scene in India has grown with
   popularity. According to a food website, the street food industry has
   grown with prominence because of its high demand in the food market.
   Another food website states that its market share is also expanding
   because of its emphasis on freshness and taste in food items.
   Consequently, the website also states that the industry’s business
   models have also flourished because of the business’s low investment
   requirement and high cost-effectiveness. Hence, street vendors have
   strived and are striving to prepare quality food which will entice
   demanding taste buds at a lower cost.


   However, some people in India also avoid street food stalls in concern
   of hygiene standards followed by vendors. They feel fearful of
   sanitation, quality, and surroundings. However, the report states that
   street food stalls usually serve a preponderance of the population in a
   city. Moreover, street food vendors across India suffer from
   displacement on a daily basis. They can also suffer from legal
   sanctions and have depleted constitutional recognition. Additionally,
   according to Anne Dahmen, a German research scholar and coordinator for
   the sustainable Hyderabad Project (SHP), eviction possibilities are
   high for street vendors because of a lack of awareness about the
   standard protocols and requirements in following the Food Safety and
   Standards Act 2006. However, Anne Dahmen also states that the
   perception and overall situation of street food surrounding uncertainty
   can be improved by the government by managing the sector better, i.e.,
   by regulating the process to be more participatory.

   This industry has grown and preserved economies in the country.
   According to a media report, if street food stalls fold permanently,
   then the high cost to be beared by a customer and effort to find food
   which has similar value would be difficult. Furthermore, according to
   Anne Dahmen, if proper training based on legalities, hygiene, and
   preparation is administered by different authorities through various
   schemes to various street vendors across India, then the street food
   industry can be pillars of sustenance for societies. For instance, the
   Hindu also reports that under a training program carried out by the SHP
   and Dr. Reddy’s foundation, which trained several street vendors, M.
   Vijay Kumar – one of the training program’s trainees saw his sales
   increase from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1000 a day after executing new methods.

   Conclusively, though some people in India avoid street food because of
   hygiene purposes, it’s role in sustaining and shaping the Indian food
   economy remains unparalleled. Additionally, though some of the street
   vendors are at risk of eviction on a daily basis, they are also the
   lifeblood of freshness and taste in taste buds across different cities
   in India. Consequently, with the right schemes of training programs
   provided by the government to street vendors, there can be a
   possibility for crucial advancement in institutional awareness
   concerning culinary legalities, acts, and hygiene practices.
   Ultimately, it is essential to understand that the Indian food economy
   is shaped by the people who serve food on the streets of cities, and
   with changes in perceptions of some citizens and recognition given by
   the government towards these people, it can become more recognizable.

   g_126689_01a.makhanlasdas_img_1106_280x210.jpg Shib Nath Das, the ninth
   generation scion running the store, Makhan Lal Das &amp; Sons
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Inside the bustling Natun Bazar neighbourhood of North Kolkata, we walk
   through narrow, muddy lanes, lined with small shops and homes, stray
   goats, and children playing, to Makhan Lal Das &amp; Sons. The
   factory-cum-shop has been in the business of selling sweetmeats since
   1830, and its nondescript appearance is no indication of its lineage.
   Shib Nath Das is the ninth generation of a family that came from
   Debrajhat village in the Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal to
   first sell sweets in the local haat, or market; he sits on a wooden
   platform, supervising the sweets that are being made to order.
   Thickened milk is made into chena (cottage cheese) and then into
   sandesh (sweets), sometimes with nolen gur (palm jaggery), sometimes
   chocolate, and sometimes a dash of saffron. Two large plates in front
   of Das contain the samples of the day, with fanciful names like ‘Mono
   Hara’ (one who steals your heart) and ‘Abar Khabo’ (I will eat again).
   Wooden moulds in different shapes and sizes lie on another board, where
   an artisan makes conch shell-shaped sweets. Small clay cups of creamy
   mango curd and different varieties of sandesh are offered to us.
   Mishti, or sweetmeats, is an integral part of Kolkata’s cuisine. Many
   attribute the beginnings of the sweet industry to the Portuguese who
   introduced cottage cheese to the region in the 16th century. Others
   claim that in those days, the milkman would often be left with unsold
   milk at the end of the day that would then go sour, and, therefore,
   chena was made (by curdling the milk) and mixed with sugar to make it
   more palatable.

   Kolkata is a veritable melting pot, with the British, Portuguese,
   Chinese, Armenians and Jews making it their home when the city became
   the hub of the East India Company in the mid-18th century. Its culinary
   heritage is a product of all these cultures and communities, which I am
   in the process of discovering while on a culinary trail curated by
   Novotel Hotels and Residences, and Indrajit Lahiri, a food blogger. By
   sampling some quintessential items from the city’s diverse foodscape,
   we get a peep into the culinary history of more than 300 years in the
   course of a few days. The Neighbours from Next Door
   Kolkata was home to India’s largest Chinatown, with the Chinese coming
   to the city in the late 18th century to set up sugar mills in a
   neighbourhood called Achipur, on the invitation of the British. We walk
   through the narrow lanes of Tiretti Bazar, which is one of the two
   Chinatowns (the other being in Tangra) where every morning prawn baos
   and dumplings are served for breakfast from the sidewalks. Large stacks
   of aluminum steamers are set up on makeshift tables: There’s
   siumai—Cantonese pork and shrimp dumplings—fish ball soup, and even
   Chinese bread shaped like churros. One vendor sells Chinese sauces,
   spices and noodles. It’s a communal atmosphere, with people sitting on
   plastic stools and reading Chinese newspapers, while others chat with
   friends.
   g_126691_2a.chinesebreakfastattirettibazaar_kolkatta_wb_280x210.jpg

   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   We continue on our Chinese food trail with a visit to Eau Chew, one of
   the oldest family-run Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, which dates back
   to the 1920s. It is located on the first floor of a building in the
   rundown compound of a garage, above a closed petrol pump, and is open
   for only 7 hours a day. Red Formica-covered tables and a no- frills
   ambience, with only a fish tank and framed photographs of the first
   owners for decoration, indicate that this experience is all about the
   food. Joel Huang, who runs the restaurant today with his mother
   Josephine and wife Doren, says his great-grandparents came in the early
   20th century and set up a small tiffin house for Chinese immigrants at
   the same location, although the name Eau Chew, in Mandarin, means
   ‘Europe’ and was intended to attract a European clientele.
   g_126693_3b.funnelsoupateauchew,theoldestchineserestaurantinkolkata_280
   x210.jpg The chimney soup at Eau Chew
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Right from chopping vegetables, cooking and billing the customers,
   everything is done by Josephine, Joel and Doren. They follow
   traditional recipes with no improvisations or variations. “Our
   customers know what they like here, and come to find that,” says Joel.
   We have their famous ‘chimney soup’ that is kept hot with glowing
   embers of coal, steamed fish with soy sauce, and hearty ‘Josephine
   noodles’ created for a customer who wanted to eat something off the
   menu and different. The dish comprises noodles topped with gravy,
   vegetables and meat. Many of the old-fashioned Chinese restaurants of
   the city, such as Nanking and Song Hay, have shut over the past few
   decades; Chung Wau in the Burra Bazaaar neighbourhood is one of the
   last of these restaurants that are still in operation, with cabins
   named after Bengali classics. It remains famous for its food, which
   includes roasted chilli pork and other dishes based on authentic
   recipes from Hakka Chinese immigrants. The old has slowly given way to
   the new, with chains like Mainland China serving more popular versions
   of Indian Chinese food. The Anglo-Indian Angle
   To get a taste of the city’s Anglo-Indian food—one of the pillars of
   its diverse culinary heritage, which is  an amalgam of  Portuguese,
   French and British  influences—we go to Scoop, inside the New Empire
   Cinema complex, in the Dharmatala area. It is an ice cream parlour and
   multi-cuisine restaurant owned by Joanna Mantosh, an Anglo Indian, and
   her husband. They have cooked up a special Anglo-Indian meal for us:
   Jungli pulao with chicken curry, yellow rice with coconut milk and
   turmeric, pantaras (deep fried, breaded meat-stuffed pancakes), and
   chicken vindaloo. Anglo Indian food was not an integral part of the
   restaurant scene in Kolkata in the past; it was cooked more at home by
   families, and shared within the community and served in a mess or
   canteen run by the community. In the early 19th century, Kolkata was
   home to a vibrant Jewish community of almost 20,000 people. Today, even
   though the community has dwindled, their beautiful synagogues, such as
   the Magen David and the Beth El in the Burra Bazaar area, survive and
   are manned by Muslim caretakers. Inside the labyrinthine alleys of New
   Market in Dharmatala, lined with shops selling everything from
   Portuguese ‘Bandel cheese’ to garments, furnishings and crockery,
   stands Nahoum, the oldest Jewish bakery in town.
   g_126695_5b.sweetbunsatnahoums_280x210.jpg Sweet buns at Nahoum
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Founded by Nahoum Israel, a Baghdadi Jew, in 1902, the shop houses
   vintage teak wood furniture, and glass shelves heaving with fruit and
   plum cakes, rum balls, lemon puffs, cream-filled pineapple pastries and
   fruit buns. The fourth generation of the family continues to own and
   run the bakery and shop, which have now become a precious piece of
   nostalgia in Kolkata’s food fabric. Our next stop is Nizam’s, next to
   New Market on Hogg’s Street. A no-frills restaurant, it is supposed to
   have invented, in the 1930s, one of the quintessential elements of
   Kolkata street food—the kaathi roll. The origins of the iconic roll are
   a bit hazy: Some say it was made for a customer who wanted a non-messy
   on-the-go snack, while others say it was made for finicky British
   clients who did not want to soil their fingers. “It’s a perfect snack
   of carbs and protein: A crisp paratha stuffed with raw onions, kebabs
   roasted on skewers, or chunks of paneer,” says Lahiri.
   g_126699_6.nizamskaatiroll_280x210.jpg Nizam’s kaathi roll
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Mughlai food, from which the kaathi roll originates, was introduced in
   Bengal under Mughal emperor Shah Jehan in the 17th century, when
   Burdwan became a revenue collection centre for Bengal. Mughlai parathas
   stuffed with kheema, and biryani were some of the most popular dishes
   at that time, and continue to remain so. Mughlai cuisine was also
   brought in from Awadh by its 10th and last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah in the
   19th century. Many of these dishes also had Turkish and Afghan
   influences, from the spices to cooking methods. Our last stop is
   Flury’s, a stylish tea room
   and confectionary shop that is a Kolkata icon from 1927, started by
   Swiss couple Joseph and Frieda Flury, and now owned by the Apeejay
   Surendra Group, who also own the Park Hotels. Located on Park Street,
   Flury’s was just a tea room to begin with and has since morphed into a
   large confectionary and restaurant famous for its breakfasts of Eggs
   Benedict and beans on toast. On offer are pineapple and chocolate
   pastries and cakes, rum balls, and a variety of confection. Like
   Nahoum’s, Flury’s is an integral part of Kolkata’s foodscape, thronged
   by college students and families for decades.
   g_126697_7a.flurys-theswissconfectioners_280x210.jpg Flury’s, a stylish
   tea room started in 1927 by a Swiss couple
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   In the past couple of decades, Kolkata has adopted to new and
   contemporary trends in food and restaurants, with sweetmeat shops and
   fine dining restaurants both catering to increasing demand. Molecular
   gastronomy and fusion fare are also popular trends. At the same time,
   the Hakka Chinese restaurants of Tangra and Tiretti Bazar, as well as
   the traditional bakeries and kaathi roll joints, continue to have their
   loyal patrons for whom food is still cloaked in nostalgia. In Kolkata,
   the old and the new exist in harmony.

   If I were to describe Indian street food with just one word, it would
   be “colorful”. It’s an assault on the senses in the best ways possible.

   India is a vast country boasting a diverse array of regional cuisines.
   Historically, it’s been known to produce up to 75% of the world’s
   spices, leading to some of the tastiest and most interesting dishes
   you’ll find anywhere on the planet.

   I’ve been a fan of Indian food for most of my adult life, but it wasn’t
   until my trip to India that I was exposed to the magical realm of
   Indian street food. There is so much interesting street food to be
   experienced in this country, many of which I had never seen anywhere
   else. From puchkas to kathi rolls to paan and jalebi, every turn led me
   to something new and delicious to tantalize both my eyes and my taste
   buds.

   I went to India looking for curry but what made the biggest impression
   was the street food. If you’re planning a trip to India and have a
   passion for street food, then listed in this article are 30 Indian
   street food dishes that you absolutely need to try.

THE BEST INDIAN STREET FOODS

    1. What is Indian Street Food?
    2. Tips for Eating Street Food in India
    3. 30 Must-Try Indian Street Foods
    4. Popular Cities for Street Food in India

WHAT IS INDIAN STREET FOOD?

   In some countries like Japan, street food is limited. Not so in India.
   Indian street food is as diverse and plentiful as Indian cuisine. Every
   region has its own specialties with city vendors offering hundreds if
   not thousands of different options.

   The history of street food in India isn’t well documented, but it’s
   widely believed that its origins can be traced back to the time when
   the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan moved his capital from Agra to Delhi.
   Chaat, the most popular type of Indian street food, was first
   introduced to Old Delhi during that time. It became popular as a
   mid-day snack after cooks from Varanasi were invited to set up shop in
   Delhi by officials of the Mughal Dynasty.

   Today, street food has become an important part of Indian culture and
   has taken root in every part of the country. Its affordability makes it
   accessible to everyone. Aside from chaat, other popular varieties of
   Indian street food include kebabs, biryani, korma, and kulfi.

TIPS FOR EATING STREET FOOD IN INDIA

   Have you heard of “Delhi belly”? It’s the term for traveler’s diarrhea
   in india. It’s very much a real thing and something you should be
   concerned about when eating the street food in India. I was aware of it
   and tried my best not to catch it, but I still suffered a bout of
   diarrhea in Mumbai, probably from street vendor ice cream.

   As tempting as it is to try every Indian street food dish that catches
   your eye, it’s best to exercise caution as you don’t want a
   debilitating case of the runs ruining your trip to India. Here are a
   few pointers to remember when eating street food in India.
    1. Look for popular street food stalls.  The more customers a stall
       has, the better and safer it’s food is likely to be.
    2. Avoid dishes and drinks made with water.  Unfiltered water is the
       main culprit for Delhi belly so avoid anything made with
       undistilled water like ice cubes, fresh fruit juices, and sauces.
       The same goes for produce washed in tap water.  If you can, find
       street food stalls that prepare their food using distilled water.
    3. Fried or grilled dishes are safer.  Heat kills bacteria so fried or
       grilled dishes are typically safer to eat.  The same goes for
       drinks.  Hot drinks like chai tea are generally safer because
       they’re made with boiled water.
    4. Avoid meat dishes.  Stay away from meat dishes if you can because
       you don’t know how long they’ve been sitting out.
    5. Go on a street food tour.  As a foreigner, it’s difficult to know
       for sure which street food stalls are safe.  For peace of mind, I
       highly recommend going on a street food tour in India.  A
       knowledgeable guide will take you to the city’s best and safest
       street food stalls so all you have to worry about is how much you
       can eat. Check out Get Your Guide for a list of food tours in
       Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and other cities in India.

30 MUST-TRY INDIAN STREET FOODS &amp; DRINKS

1. Nimbu Masala Soda

   I went on a food tour in Mumbai and the first place we went to was a
   stall selling nimbu masala soda. According to my guide, it was a great
   way of prepping our stomachs for the many street food dishes we were
   about to have.

   Nimbu masala soda is a carbonated drink made with lemon juice and soda
   water mixed with chaat masala (a spice mix), cumin, and kala namak
   (black salt). It’s a tasty and intriguing blend of sweet, sour, spicy,
   and savory that you’d never expect from a drink.

   Nimbu masala soda is popular throughout India where it goes by many
   names like banta soda, goli soda, goti soda, and fotash jawl. It’s
   especially popular in North India and Delhi where it’s enjoyed as a
   summer cooler and referred to as “Delhi’s local drink”.

   I had it in Delhi as well on a food tour, but towards the end of our
   tour, perhaps to aid in digestion.

2. Masala Chai

   If you’re a frequent customer at Starbucks, then you’ve probably heard
   of chai tea. Widely consumed throughout India and South Asia, it’s a
   tea beverage of Indian origin that’s become a staple at cafe and
   teahouse menus around the world.

   Recipes for masala chai vary but it’s typically made by boiling a
   strong black tea like Assam tea in a buffalo milk and water mixture.
   It’s brewed with a spice mix called karha which is made using a base of
   ground ginger and cardamom pods. Depending on the person making it,
   other spices can be added to the karha mixture like cinnamon, nutmeg,
   cloves, peppercorn, star anise, and fennel seeds.

   Masala chai is a staple drink in Indian households and often sold at
   roadside stalls throughout the country. When enjoyed at home, it’s
   usually consumed in the morning with breakfast, or offered to guests as
   a sign of hospitality. It’s a warming drink that can be enjoyed as is
   or sweetened with sugar, syrup, honey, or jaggery.

3. Lassi

   Other than chai tea, lassi is perhaps the most internationally
   well-known drink of Indian origin. It refers to a probiotic drink made
   with a blend of dahi (yogurt), water, and spices.

   Lassi is traditionally made with yogurt and water and can be either
   salty or sweet. Sweet versions of lassi are typically flavored with
   sugar, rosewater, or different types of blended fruit like mango,
   lemon, strawberry, and other fruit juices. It’s a refreshingly sweet
   and tart drink that’s similar in consistency to a milkshake.

   Lassi is especially popular in the northern parts of India.
   Interestingly, some regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat flavor lassi
   with saffron, while cannabis-infused versions called “bhang” are often
   consumed during festivals like Holi and Maha Shivaratri. Leaves from
   the cannabis plant are ground into a paste and mixed into the lassi.

   In an India episode of No Reservations, the late great Anthony Bourdain
   was taken to a licensed bhang shop in Rajasthan where he was offered
   five types of bhang lassi – baby lassi, medium, normal strong, super
   duper sexy strong, and “full power, 24 hour, no toilet, no shower”. My
   man went with the full power. Ha!

   Pictured below are traditional lassis served in clay pots. After
   serving, the clay pots are broken and then recycled to create new pots.

   Can you guess what type of lassi this is? It’s a mug of sweet lassi
   flavored with pomegranate. Not quite super duper sexy strong but very
   good and highly addictive nonetheless.

4. Masala Chana Dal Chaat

   Chaat is the most popular type of Indian street food. The term refers
   to a family of savory Indian snacks, some of the most popular being
   samosas, kachori, dahi vadas, vada pav, and pav bhaji.

   To be honest, I find the concept of chaat confusing because the dishes
   can sometimes look so different. Based on its definition, it refers to
   Indian street foods made with a crisp starchy base like fried dough or
   crispy puffed rice. There are many different types of chaat made with a
   variety of additional ingredients, but the common denominator is the
   crisp starchy base.

   That’s the definition, but I still don’t completely understand it
   because some dishes that are categorized as chaat don’t seem to fit the
   description. In any case, I think the concept of chaat – like the side
   head nod – is something that only locals can fully grasp.

   Pictured below is a type of chaat made with chana dal (split baby
   chickpeas) mixed with chaat masala and other ingredients like peanuts,
   chopped onion, coriander, and lime. It reminded me of an Indian version
   of trail mix, but much more interesting and flavorful.

   India Chana dal chaat in a small bag, one of the most common street
   foods in India

5. Aloo Chana Chaat

   Aloo means “potato” so you can probably guess what type of chaat this
   is by its name. Its made with split baby chickpeas (chana) and fried or
   boiled potatoes flavored with spices, chutney, and other ingredients.
   If it’s made with yogurt (dahi), then it’s called dahi aloo chana
   chaat.

   Like the chana dal chaat, it’s a fun Indian street food snack that goes
   very well with beer. In fact, both of these stalls were located side by
   side in Kolkata, just outside a liquor store. Location is everything.

6. Bhel Puri

   Bhel puri (or bhelpuri) is a type of chaat made with crunchy puffed
   rice, sev (fried chickpea noodles), puri, chana dal, vegetables, and
   spices. It’s strongly associated with the beaches of Mumbai, like
   Chowpatty, where it’s often enjoyed and referred to as a “beach snack”.

   Bhel puri can be served either wet (gaela bhel) or dry (sukha bel). Wet
   bhel puri is made with the addition of chutneys like tamarind chutney
   or green coriander chutney, but the base ingredients remain the same.
   It’s a crunchy and fun snack with an interesting mix of savory, sweet,
   sour, and spicy flavors.

7. Jhalmuri

   Jhalmuri is a spicy and tangy version of bhel puri that’s popular in
   Kolkata and West Bengal. Jhal means “spicy” while muri refers to the
   puffed rice.

   Like bhel puri, jhalmuri is made with puffed rice and a mix of
   ingredients like sev, roasted peanuts, tomatoes, onions, lemon juice,
   herbs, and spices. What makes jhalmuri special is the addition of
   mustard oil which gives the snack its characteristic spicy and pungent
   flavor.

8. Poha

   Poha refers to flattened or beaten rice. It can be used to refer to
   both the ingredient and the Indian dishes made with it. It’s a popular
   Indian breakfast staple that’s also commonly sold as street food.

   To prepare, rice is parboiled and then flattened, resulting in crispy
   thin flakes that can be consumed with little to no cooking. They can be
   eaten raw after a bit of soaking or fried and roasted with other
   ingredients. Poha is popular throughout India where it’s known by many
   names like avalakki, paunva, poya, pauwa, and aval.

   There are many Indian dishes made with poha but one of the most
   well-known is Indori poha with jalebi. It’s a beloved breakfast and
   street food dish from Indore made with poha, jalebi, sev, onions, and
   fennel seeds.

9. Pani Puri / Puchka / Gol Gappa

   Pani puri is one of the most interesting street foods I had in India.
   It refers to a popular type of chaat made with crispy hollow balls
   called puri. Preparations vary by region but they’re typically filled
   with a mixture of flavored water, tamarind chutney, mint chutney, chaat
   masala, green chili, onions, chickpeas, and potato mash. It’s popular
   throughout India where it goes by different names like puchka, gol
   gappa, fulki, pakodi, and gup chup.

   Aside from its interesting mix of sweet, spicy, and sour flavors, what
   make pani puri so interesting is how it’s prepared. The top of the puri
   is punctured and filled with the spice mixture before the whole thing
   is dunked in tamarind water. The puri is delicate, like a potato chip,
   so you’re instructed to eat the pani puri whole before it
   disintegrates. The vendor will keep filling puri arter puri until you
   tell him to stop.

   According to my guides, pani puri is especially popular with Indian
   women, many of whom are known to consume over twenty pani puris in one
   sitting. They’re like little flavor bombs on your taste buds and
   something that you absolutely need to try in India.

   With that said, be careful where you eat pani puri because they’re made
   with water. For that reason, I recommend trying them on a food tour.

10. Dahi Vada

   Dahi vada is a type of chaat made by soaking vadas in a thick yogurt
   sauce. Vadas are soft lentil fritters while dahi refers to yogurt, so
   the name dahi vadas literally means “fritters soaked in yogurt”. It’s a
   popular Indian festival dish that’s also commonly sold as street food.

   To prepare, urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter
   before being deep-fried. They’re then soaked in water and drained
   before being covered in a thick beaten yogurt sauce. Before serving,
   they’re usually topped with green coriander chutney, tamarind chutney,
   and a host of spices and garnishes like cumin, chili powder, chaat
   masala, and pomegranate seeds. Creamy, tangy, and sweet, the vadas have
   an interesting texture that’s similar to soft fluffy donuts.

   Like many of the dishes in this Indian street food guide, dahi vada is
   popular throughout the country where it goes by different names like
   dahi bhalla, dahi bade, thayir vadai, doi bora, and thairu vada.

11. Kanji Vada

   Kanji vada is a traditional Rajasthani street food dish made with vadas
   soaked in mustard-flavored fermented water called kanji or rai ka
   paani. The vadas are made from a combination of moong dal and urad dal
   flavored with green chili peppers, ginger, and salt. The vadas are left
   to soak in the kanji for several minutes before serving to absorb its
   mustardy flavor.

   During the Holi festival, a special type of kanji vadas is prepared
   using chakundar kanji. Chakundar kanji is a type of kanji made with
   fermented beetroot and carrots that give the liquid a rich red color.

12. Kachori

   Kachori is a type of chaat made with deep-fried breads. It’s popular
   throughout India where it goes by many names like kachauri, katchuri,
   and kachodi.

   You can’t tell from this picture but the kachori itself is shaped like
   a round flattened ball (similar to aloo tikki) filled with a stuffing.
   Depending on where it’s from, fillings can vary but common stuffing
   ingredients include yellow moong dal, urad dal, besan (gram flour),
   black pepper, chili powder, cumin, and other spices. From what I
   understand, kachori is usually savory but it can also be sweet.

   Kachori can be eaten on its own or in this case, drenched in gravy. I
   had this version from a stall in Chandni Chowk that was smothered in
   aloo ki sabzi, which is a type of spicy potato curry. According to my
   guide, this stall is known for serving some of the best kachori in
   Delhi.

13. Aloo Tikki

   Aloo tikki is a type of Indian fritter made with deep-fried mashed
   potatoes. Aloo means “potato” while tikki refers to a small cutlet or
   croquette. You can think of aloo tikki as the Indian version of hash
   browns.

   Aloo tikki can be made with or without a stuffing. To prepare, boiled
   potatoes are mashed and formed into patties before being filled with
   ingredients like coriander, peas, chana dal, and different herbs and
   spices. The patties are then deep-fried and served with a sauce like
   tamarind chutney, green coriander chutney, tomato chutney, or dahi.

14. Samosa

   Samosa is one of the most popular dishes in Indian cuisine. It’s widely
   available throughout India as street food or as an appetizer or snack
   at restaurants, cafes, and gatherings.

   Samosa refers to a pastry filled with savory ingredients like potatoes,
   peas, onions, lentils, meat, herbs, and spices. It’s often shaped like
   a triangle or pyramid but it can take other forms as well depending on
   where it’s made. Samosas can be baked or fried and often served with
   tamarind chutney or green coriander chutney.

   I’ve always associated samosas with Indian cuisine so it was
   interesting to learn that it may not be an Indian dish after all, at
   least not originally. It’s believed to have originated in the Middle
   East sometime in the 10th century and was brought to India by merchants
   who enjoyed it as an easy on-the-go snack. It’s earliest mention was in
   the Iranian history book Tarikh-i Bayhaqi, where it was referred to as
   “sambosa”.

   Samosa may not be Indian in origin but it’s very much a part of Indian
   cuisine now. It’s also popular in other parts of South Asia, the Middle
   East, Southeast Asia, Western Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa.

15. Pakora

   Pakora refers to a type of spiced fritter made with a variety of
   ingredients, usually vegetables, coated in seasoned gram flour batter
   and then deep-fried. They’re usually eaten as a snack or appetizer with
   tamarind sauce, chutney, or raita.

   Some of the most common ingredients used to make pakoras include
   onions, potatoes, plantains, paneer (Indian cottage cheese), and green
   chilies, though they can be made with animal proteins like meat and
   fish as well.

   Enjoyed in countries throughout South Asia like India, Pakistan, Sri
   Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh, it’s a tasty and crunchy snack that goes
   by different names like bhajia, bhaji, pakoda, or bora.

16. Dosa

   Dosas are thin rice and lentil crepes made from ground and fermented
   lentil-rice batter. It’s become popular throughout the Indian
   subcontinent but it’s a well-known South Indian dish that’s commonly
   eaten for breakfast or as a snack.

   To prepare, lentils and rice are soaked for several hours before being
   ground separately to a fine consistency. They’re then seasoned with
   salt and allowed to ferment overnight. When ready, the batter is poured
   onto a cast-iron pan or skillet and cooked like a crepe till golden
   brown and crispy.

   There are many types of dosa. They can be eaten plain or stuffed with a
   filling made from vegetables, potatoes, and spices. Pictured below is
   one of the most common types of dosa called masala dosa. It’s made with
   potato masala and served with different sides like chutney and sambar
   (lentil-based vegetable curry).

17. Paratha

   Paratha is a crisp and chewy Indian flatbread made with whole wheat
   flour. It’s popular throughout the Indian subcontinent where it’s
   typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack with various side dishes
   like chutneys, yogurt, and pickled vegetables.

   The process for making parathas is similar to laminated dough. Whole
   wheat dough is rolled and folded multiple times while being layered
   with ghee before being pan-fried. It can be served plain of filled with
   various ingredients like potato, vegetables, and paneer.

   Unlike other types of Indian flatbread like roti or naan which are
   typically consumed as a side dish to curries, paratha is often enjoyed
   as a standalone dish.

18. Pav Bhaji

   Pav bhaji was one of my favorite street foods in India. It’s a simple
   dish but it’s comforting and absolutely delicious.

   Pav bhaji is originally from Mumbai where it was invented as a quick
   lunchtime dish for the city’s textile mill workers in the 1850s. The
   dish caught on and started appearing on restaurant menus in Mumbai and
   throughout the country.

   Pav bhaji consists of a thick spiced curry made with potatoes and
   vegetables like onions, peas, bell peppers, and tomatoes. The potatoes
   and vegetables are cooked with spices before being mashed and served
   with a soft buttery bread roll. Pav means “bread roll” while bhaji
   refers to vegetables or vegetable-based dishes.

   Together with vada pav, pav bhaji is one of the most popular street
   foods in Mumbai. I suggest trying it at Chowpatty or Juhu Beach. It’s
   the perfect dish to snack on while enjoying the view of the ocean.

19. Bombay Sandwich

   As you can probably guess from the name, the Bombay sandwich is a
   popular street food sandwich in Mumbai. It’s a vegetarian sandwich made
   with beetroot, boiled potatoes, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers,
   cucumbers, chaat masala, and mint chutney sandwiched between buttered
   slices of white bread.

   Bombay sandwiches can be made with plain or toasted bread. The
   beautiful specimen pictured below was made by inserting the sandwich in
   a metal clamp and grilling it over charcoal. It was then cut into
   portions and drizzled with ketchup before serving. Delicious!

20. Vada Pav

   Like pav bhaji, vada pav is one of the most popular street foods in
   Mumbai. You can think of it as an Indian vegetarian slider made with
   deep-fried mashed potato fritters (batata vada) served in a soft bread
   roll.

   To prepare, boiled potatoes are mashed and mixed with garlic, green
   chili peppers, mustard seeds, and spices. The seasoned mash is then
   shaped into a ball and dipped in besan flour before being deep-fried
   and served in a bread roll with fried green chilies and one or more
   chutneys (garlic chutney, mint chutney, tomato chutney, etc).

   Most vada pav sandwiches seem to be made with one large batata vada or
   potato dumpling. This version from a hugely popular stall in Mumbai was
   made with smaller potato fritters for more texture and crunch.

21. Dabeli

   Originally from the Kutch region of Gujarat, dabeli is a type of Indian
   sandwich that looks similar to vada pav. But unlike vada pav which is
   savory, dabeli is more sweet and tangy.

   Dabeli is made with a spice mixture called dabeli masala which consists
   of cumin, cloves, coriander seeds, cinnamon, and red chili peppers.
   It’s mixed into a cooked potato mash and served in a bread roll with
   grated coconut, coriander, pomegranate seeds, sev, onions, roasted
   peanuts, and one or more chutneys.

22. Kathi Roll

   The kathi roll (or kati roll) is a type of wrap that was invented and
   popularized by Nizam’s restaurant in Kolkata. It consists of kebab meat
   wrapped with various vegetables, egg, and chutney in paratha flatbread.

   In its original form, kathi rolls were made only with beef but they’re
   now made with other proteins as well like chicken tikka, mutton, or
   even just vegetables. It’s believed that the kathi roll was created to
   attract British customers. Office commuters didn’t have the time for
   traditional kebab dishes so the kathi roll was invented as a quick and
   portable way of consuming kebabs.

   Kati in Bengali means “stick” and refers to the bamboo skewer used to
   cook the kebabs. It’s an incredibly tasty wrap that’s easy to eat on
   the go.

   Pictured below is the lip-smackingly delicious chicken tikka kathi roll
   from Kusum Rolls in Kolkata. It’s a bit oily on the hands but a real
   joy to the taste buds. Be sure to try their egg rolls and mutton rolls
   as well.

23. Kebab

   The kebab is a hugely popular dish that’s consumed in many parts of the
   world, including India. It refers to grilled meat dishes skewered on
   metal or bamboo sticks. Traditionally, they’re made with mutton or lamb
   but they can be made with other proteins as well like chicken, beef,
   goat, and fish.

   In India, the origin of modern-day kebabs can be traced back to the
   kitchens of the Mughal Empire. Indian kebabs can be made with skewered
   cubed meat (shish kebab) or ground meat (seekh kebab) that’s heavily
   seasoned with Indian spices.

   One of the most well-known types of Indian kebab is the tunde ke kabab
   or buffalo meat galouti kebab from Lucknow. I don’t know how true this
   is, but the original version of this buffalo meat kebab was said to
   have been made with a staggering 160 spices.

24. Bombay Duck Rava Fry

   Bombay duck is a misnomer. It describes a popular Mumbai dish that
   isn’t made with fowl, but fish. Bombay duck refers to Harpadon
   nehereus, a species of lizardfish (no, it isn’t a reptile either) that
   thrives in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific.

   Also known as bombil, Bombay duck is used in many dishes but one of the
   tastiest has to be Bombay duck rava fry. It’s made by coating bombil
   fillets in a spiced rava (semolina) and rice flour mixture before
   shallow-frying them till crispy and golden brown. Crunchy on the
   outside but soft and buttery on the inside, it’s absolutely delicious.

   Pictured below is a Bombay duck thali (full plate meal) with rice,
   chapati, chutney, and solkhadi, which is a type of curry drink made
   with coconut milk and kokum fruit.

25. Mishti Doi

   Mishti doi is a traditional Bengali dessert made with sweetened
   fermented caramelized dahi (yogurt). Mishti in Bengali means “sweet”
   and doi means “curd”, so mishti doi literally translates to “sweet
   curd”. In Hindi, it’s known as meetha dahi.

   To prepare, milk is boiled until it’s slightly thickened. It’s then
   sweetened with brown sugar or jaggery and allowed to set and ferment
   overnight with curd. No flavorings are usually added though it’s common
   to sneak in just a pinch of cardamom for fragrance.

   Mishti doi is always made in earthenware bowls because the porous walls
   facilitate the evaporation of water and further thickens the yogurt. It
   also allows for the ideal temperature for the growth of the culture.

26. Jalebi

   Jalebi is one of the most common Indian street food desserts. It’s a
   hugely popular snack that’s enjoyed in many parts of India and across
   South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.

   This bright orange snack is made from a fermented batter made with
   all-purpose flour and besan flour. The batter is poured in concentric
   circles into hot oil and deep-fried. The fried spirals are then soaked
   in a sugar syrup mixture before serving.

   Jalebi has a crunchy crystalized sugary coating that’s very sweet. It’s
   eaten on its own as a snack or for dessert but it can be paired with
   savory dishes as well. In Indore, it’s commonly eaten with poha for
   breakfast or as a street food dish.

27. Doodhpak

   Doodhpak refers to this delicious Indian dessert pudding from Gujarat.
   It’s made with milk and basmati rice flavored with sugar, saffron,
   cardamom, raisins, pistachios, and almonds. It’s a rich and creamy
   dessert with great texture from the nuts and just the right amount of
   sweetness.

28. Kulfi

   Kulfi refers to a family of frozen Indian desserts. It’s often
   described as traditional Indian ice cream though its consistency is
   denser, like frozen ice cream bars. It’s popular throughout India and
   the rest of the subcontinent.

   Kulfi is made with milk and sugar flavored with fruits, nuts, and
   spices. To prepare, the sweetened and flavored milk is slowly heated
   and thickened before being quickly frozen in tightly sealed molds. This
   fast freezing process produces a smooth ice cream devoid of ice
   crystals. Kulfi comes in many flavors but some of the most traditional
   include mango (pictured below), pistachio, rose, cardamom, and saffron.

   Because kulfi is denser than western ice cream, it takes longer to melt
   which is ideal for India’s scorching climate. This mango kulfi was
   delicious and refreshing and something you’ll probably look for
   everyday in India.

   kulfi, a popular ice cream in India

   I went on a street food tour in Delhi and our last stop was this iconic
   stall famous for their stuffed kulfi. It refers to kulfi made from
   fruit pulp which is then stuffed back into the fruit before being
   frozen and set. How they manage to do that I have no idea.

   This is what my mango kulfi looked like before it was sliced up and
   served to me. You can choose from four stuffed kulfi flavors – mango,
   apple, orange, and pomegranate. I wish I could have tried all four.

29. Sancha Ice Cream

   Sancha ice cream is a type of Indian ice cream that gets its name from
   the vessel used to make it – a sancha. The sancha is a hand-powered
   device that was invented in the mid-19th century to allow people to
   make ice cream at home.

   This heritage sancha ice cream shop was the last stop on our Mumbai
   street food tour. We got two flavors – Alphonso mango and custard
   apple. Both were delicious. Unlike kulfi which is frozen, sancha ice
   cream is closer in consistency to a creamy western-style ice cream.

   This bucket filled with rock salt and ice forms part of the sancha. The
   other part is a metal cylinder that goes into this bucket. The cylinder
   is filled with ice cream which is hand-churned as it freezes to keep
   ice crystals from forming.

30. Paan

   Paan (or pan) isn’t really a dish, but more like a digestive or mouth
   freshener. It consists of betel leaf filled with chopped betel (areca)
   nuts and slaked lime to which a plethora of other ingredients like rose
   petal preserves, seeds, nuts, banana syrup, coconut shavings, and
   spices may be added. It’s chewed thoroughly before being spit out or
   swallowed.

   Paan originated in India but it’s widely consumed throughout South
   Asia, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. In India, it can be made with chewing
   tobacco or flavored with an endless array of ingredients like
   chocolate, mango, cola, or pineapple. A fiery version called “flaming
   paan” even went viral on social media. It’s literally a fire ball that
   explodes with flavor on your taste buds.

   As colorful and interesting as paan is, it isn’t without its
   controversies. It acts like a caffeine-like stimulant and is known to
   be addictive. It can cause tooth and gum decay and the consumption of
   areca nut has been linked to certain cancers. On top of that, it’s
   unsightly.

   Chewing paan turns your saliva red which can be an eyesore when spat
   out onto public sidewalks. To combat this, the government has taken
   measures to ban or limit the sale of paan, and to issue fines for
   spitting out paan juice in public.

POPULAR CITIES FOR STREET FOOD IN INDIA

   Street food is popular all throughout India but some cities are better
   known for it than others. Listed below are five of the most popular
   cities for street food in India.

1. Delhi

   It’s no surprise that Delhi tops this list considering that it may
   indeed be the city that first popularized street food in India. Just
   spend a day exploring the labyrinthine alleyways of Chandni Chowk and
   you’ll be mesmerized by its dizzying array of street food!

   I went on a street food tour in Old Delhi and got to experience some of
   the city’s tastiest examples of jalebi, pani puri, paratha, kachori,
   kulfi, and more. Delhi has a reputation for having some of the best
   food in India and its street food is no exception.

2. Kolkata

   Like Delhi, Kolkata is often cited for being one of the best cities for
   street food in India. It’s the birthplace of the kathi roll and home to
   many delicious street food dishes like jhalmuri, puchkas, Mughlai
   parathas, and the Kolkata fish fry.

   I went on a food tour in Kolkata and got to experience a plethora of
   street food dishes along with other tasty examples of Bengali cuisine.
   My guide even took me to a few heritage stalls that have been open for
   well over a hundred years!

3. Mumbai

   Mumbai was my favorite city in India and much of that has to do with
   the food. Surrounded by the Arabian Sea, it’s home to fantastic seafood
   dishes like garlic butter crab and Bombay duck, not to mention a wealth
   of tasty street foods like vada pav, pav bhaji, bhel puri, aloo tikki,
   dosas, and the Bombay sandwich.

4. Lucknow

   Lucknow is one of the best cities in India to visit for non-vegetarian
   food. It’s known for its Nawabi and Awadhi dishes, none more beloved
   perhaps than the tunde ke kabab, which is a type of kebab made with
   finely minced buffalo meat. Other popular street foods in Lucknow
   include chaat, aloo tikki, lassi, and kulfi.

5. Indore

   Indore is often called the food capital of central India, and with good
   reason. It’s famous for its Indori poha with jalebi and other tasty
   street food dishes like dahi vadas, bhutte ka kees, khatta samosas, and
   kulfi falooda.

FINAL THOUGHTS ON INDIAN STREET FOOD

   30 street food dishes may seem like a lot in many countries but not in
   India. In this vast country where street food is life, this list of 30
   is just the very tip of the iceberg. But I do hope it gives you enough
   to go on and gets you even more excited to experience the street food
   in India.

   As with all our food guides, this Indian street food guide is a
   perennial work-in-progress that will continue to grow and get better
   after each return visit to India. If you know Indian street food well
   and have any suggestions for us, then do let us know in the comments
   below. We love getting suggestions from locals and learning about new
   dishes.

   Thanks for reading and have an amazing (and safe) time exploring the
   street food in India!

   World Cuisine, India

   As one of the most populous countries in the world, India showcases a
   diverse blend of cultures and regional identities, which have been
   shaped throughout history. The best way to experience this while in
   India is through cuisine.

   Due to religious influences, India actually has the highest rate of
   vegetarianism in the world. Throughout history, the Mongolians,
   Persians, Chinese, and European colonizers influenced the cuisine in
   India. Today, Indian cuisine is most notably known for being flavorful,
   due to its diverse use of spices.

Read on to find out about India’s cuisine and street food.

Background information of Indian cuisine

   You may have noticed that most traditional Indian dishes are meatless,
   including Channa Masal, Saag Paneer, and Malai Kofta. This is because
   about a third of people in India are vegetarian, due to Hindu, Jain, or
   Buddhist faiths. When exploring India’s restaurant scene or street
   foods, you’ll see that dishes are labeled as “Non-Veg” because the
   default is vegetarian; “non-veg '' means it has meat!

   The Ayurvedic philosophy is quite prominent in Indian culture, which
   highlights the importance of balance between mind, body, and spirit.
   This directly influences the way people cook and enjoy food in India.
   You can see this incorporated into the cuisine, which varies greatly
   based on the region. The country's culinary essence does have certain
   threads that unite the variety of practices and techniques.

    A key component that characterizes Indian cuisine is the heavy use of
   7 fundamental spices, which include cumin, clove, coriander, cinnamon,
   turmeric, fenugreek, and cardamom.  You’ll also find numerous other
   spices in Indian cuisine like chili pepper, ginger, garlic, turmeric,
   saffron, nutmeg, mustard seeds, and even mint.
   For Westerners, the most familiar spice mix is called Garam Masala
   which simply means “hot spice mix.” This is used in the most common
   Indian dish, curry. Filled with spices, vegetables, and legumes, these
   gravy-like dishes are a staple to the Indian diet, usually enjoyed with
   iconic basmati rice or fluffy naan bread.

India’s Regional Cuisine

   Cooking styles and techniques vary in Northern, Western, Eastern, and
   Southern India. Below we’ll explore these regional varieties of Indian
   food.

Northern India

   The most common style found outside of India is probably Northern
   Indian cuisine, with high use of dairy products like milk, yogurt, ghee
   (clarified butter), and paneer (a semi-soft, non-aged cheese with a
   mild flavor).

   Northern snacks consist of samosas and pastries that are fried and
   filled with potatoes. Main dishes, commonly cooked in tandoors or clay
   ovens, are chicken stews, dal (lentils), paneer curries, or kormas are
   stews made with coconut milk or yogurt. You can immerse yourself in
   Indian cuisine in our small-group tour to Northern India.

   more elements, like fried onions, pakoras, and thick creamy tomato
   gravy. Photo: Shachi Bakliwal

Western Indian

   This cuisine is influenced by geographical history in its three main
   regions. The first region is Goa, a major trade port and once a colony
   of Portugal. Goan cuisine includes more vinegar, pork, and beef, which
   directly correlates to the Portuguese way of cooking and eating.

   The second one is Gujarat, a region known for being prominently
   vegetarian and with a strong Chinese influence. The climate of this
   region is drier, and vegetables are more scarce. This is why this
   region is known for chutneys and pickled vegetables for
   preservation. Lastly, Maharashtra is a region known for fish and
   seafood curries cooked in coconut milk.

Eastern India

   Eastern Indian cuisine is known for its desserts, which are lightly
   sweetened and the perfect way to finish a meal. A very common dessert
   is called rasgulla, which is a sweet semolina and cheese ball boiled in
   light sugar syrup. There are also a number of popular deep-fried
   desserts from this region, such as Theukua and Pantua.

Southern India

   South Indian cuisine is very diverse, unique, and underrated on an
   international level. They are known for their poriyals, a drier version
   of a curry packed with vegetables and enjoyed with a side of rice.
   Samabars and rasams are stews or soups, cooked with peas and tamarind,
   making sweet and tangy sauces. Apart from curries, this region of India
   has its own version of savory crepes called dosas made from rice flour
   and filled with vegetables and chutneys.

India Street Food: Dos and Don’ts

   Street food in India has a culture of its own; however before you dig
   into it while traveling there, there are some do’s and don’ts to follow
   to avoid any angry tummies.
    1. Do not fear any fried or roasted snacks.
       Fried or roasted goodies have been cooked in very hot temperatures,
       meaning all or most bacteria are completely removed. Some examples
       are samosas, aloo tikkis, dosas, jalebis (similar to funnel cakes),
       and even roasted nuts. Look for snacks that come straight out of
       the hot oil; avoid those that have been sitting or are cooled.
    2. Use caution with foods that include dairy. Though Indians, by and
       large, do not eat beef, as cows are holy, you will find an
       abundance of dairy. Unpasteurized and fresh dairy spoils faster and
       more easily in heat, including things like dahi puri or
       yogurt-based sauces. When consuming dairy, look for hot sources
       (such as paneer in your hot curry) or a piping hot chai masala. For
       yogurt-based dishes such as the popular lassi be sure to choose a
       trusted and clean vendor. As your local guide for suggestions.
    3. Check water sources. Look for vendors that use packaged water for
       cleaning of the food. And on that note, avoid fresh, raw greens but
       rather opt for those that are cooked and served hot.
    4. Do not buy pre-sliced fruit. Even though fruits like watermelon or
       cantaloupe look vibrant, delicious, and refreshing when cut on the
       street, they are susceptible to bacteria when laying under the sun
       or in hot weather for too long.
    5. Always have your own reusable water bottle and filter. While
       wandering the streets of India, always have your own reusable water
       bottle and water filters to prevent dehydration. Also, seek water
       from the most reliable sources.

Must-Try Street Foods While in India

   A country as diverse as mentioned above, India is a foodie’s paradise,
   filled with opportunities to taste local delicacies that are unlike
   anything you have tried before. Here are some of our favorites:
     * Masala Chai is an Indian beverage made from brewed black tea with a
       mixture of aromatic spices, such as green cardamom seeds, cinnamon,
       cloves, and black pepper. It is traditionally served in clay cups
       and enjoyed hot.
     * Paan is not a food per-say, it is a chewing experience that has
       been practiced for more than 2,500 years. This after-dinner treat
       consists of betel leaf and is enjoyed with a variety of flavors and
       textures put on top. This traditional Southeast Indian treat is
       meant to give freshness, aid with digestion, and leave a sweet note
       after a savory meal. It is also meant to symbolize royalty.
     * Kachori is a unique and satiating snack similar to empanadas. They
       can be found in Delhi and Jaipuri, and consists of a spicy
       deep-fried patty made of flour and filling made of lentils, beans,
       and many spices.

   and Dhokla (right), a gram flour steamed cake.

     * Aloo Chaat is another common snack found all over the streets of
       India. It is made of potatoes, sweet and sour tamarind chutneys,
       coriander leaves, and ground spices, and garnished with crunchy sev
       made from chickpea flour. In Hindi, Aloo means potatoes and chaat
       stands for “a mix of sweet, sour, and hot flavors;”  hence the name
       of this delicious street food treat.

     * Samosas are a popular appetizer or snack, quite similar to the
       previously mentioned kachoris, but with a triangular shape, and are
       fried or baked. They are usually stuffed with ground potatoes,
       onions, and peas, and are enjoyed with a side of mint or tomato
       chutney.
     * Lassi is a creamy and tangy yogurt-based drink, that originated in
       the region of Punjab, and has become quite a popular beverage
       around the country, and the world too. The yogurt blend is flavored
       with Indian spices, such as roasted cumin, but the sweet version is
       blended with sugar and fruits.

     * Pani Puri is hollow deep-fried semolina or wheat balls
       traditionally served with potatoes, chickpeas, and a spicy tamarind
       sauce, that are used as filling once cracking the fried ball’s top.
       They are enjoyed on the streets throughout the whole nation but are
       known to originate from up north in the state of Bihar.

Street Food: the story

Street Food has existed ever since the first urban settlements were created.

   The most ancient evidence of food prepared and cooked on the street
   dates back to the dawn of civilisation, around ten thousand years ago.
   The ancient Greeks described the Egyptian custom, traditional in the
   port of Alexandria and subsequently adopted throughout Greece, of
   frying fish and selling it in the street. From Greece, the custom
   spread to the Roman world, enriched and transformed into numerous
   variations. In the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompei, the
   well-preserved remains of the typical “thermopolia” can be seen,
   forerunners of today’s food stalls. These were a kind of mini-kitchen
   facing directly onto the street, used for selling all types of cooked
   food, particularly stews of farro, beans or cicerchia.  At that time
   the less wealthy city dwellers lived in apartments, essentially blocks
   of flats, mostly without kitchens. So the populace ate in the street,
   buying their food from the nearest thermopolium, which supplied
   nourishing dishes affordable by all.

   And thus street food has evolved over the centuries in parallel with
   our civilisation, but discreetly, leaving very few traces considering
   its close links with the common people. But during the Middle Ages the
   big cities were bursting with stalls, huts and carts selling cheap
   ready-cooked food in the grubby streets of the seedier neighbourhoods.
   However, as is often the case, out of poverty comes the best of human
   ingenuity, and hence came the immortal recipes at the base of an entire
   culinary culture.  So in Paris there were the “pâtés”, or rather
   “pâstés”, pastry cases enclosing various fillings, usually stewed meat
   or vegetables, sold for a few pennies to errand boys and labourers so
   that they could eat while they worked, with no need for cutlery. These
   would lead to the term “patisserie” and during the Renaissance and the
   Enlightenment become the glory of grand tables all over Europe in the
   form of timbales, savoury pies and pastries of all kinds filled with
   truffles, pigeon and foie gras. The very same humble principle as the
   pies of the anglo-saxon lower classes: a crust made of flour, lard and
   water containing a cooked filling, eaten by English miners and factory
   workers during the industrial revolution. The crust was thrown away, as
   it would be soiled by coal or machine oil from their hands. British too
   is the veritable institution of fish and chips, sold on the street and
   wrapped in newspaper - a legacy of Sephardic Jewish refugees fleeing
   persecution during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.
   This custom of fried fish to take away is the very same as that of the
   Egyptians in Alexandria, which spread across the whole of North Africa
   and Moorish Spain of El Andalus.


“TERRITORY AND TRADITION” IT’S TALKED ABOUT, IT’S BOASTED ABOUT.

   This is perhaps the greatest misapprehension about street food: because
   it was born poor, from the  primary need to feed the populace cheaply,
   it has always been considered of little worth. However, particularly in
   these times of globalisation, street food is often the last bastion of
   a place’s traditions and identity. Consider the panino con la milza
   (bread with spleen) of Sicilian markets, or with lampredotto (tripe)
   sold at the last of the tripe stalls in Florence.  Pizza itself, the
   emblem of popular Italian cuisine, occupies the same role as the
   English pie, arising from the need to feed the poor in the streets. In
   this context, street food identifies and distinguishes territory and
   tradition, keeping alive one of the most important aspects of local
   culture, the eating habits of the people.

   In more recent times, we have seen an abundance of vehicles springing
   up near stadiums and concert venues, fairs and markets - vehicles
   specially adapted to sell drinks and sandwiches, classically with
   sausage or roast pork, the Italian version of American hot dogs and
   hamburgers, which themselves descended from the traditions of poor
   immigrants from Hamburg and Frankfurt.  Today’s street food culture is
   taking a markedly different route, focusing on the traditional cultural
   aspect - sometimes a rediscovery - and investing in the quality of
   increasingly refined products. Paradoxically, this trend for revival
   comes form the very place that invented junk food - the United States,
   where the trendiest food trucks are wildly popular among increasingly
   sophisticated foodies and related media.


“STREET FOOD IS THE TRUE TESTIMONY TO THE IDENTITY OF A PEOPLE”

   IThe manifesto of today’s Street Food could be “Street food is the true
   testimony to the identity of a people”. It undoubtedly gauges the depth
   of traditional food culture, but also measures its ability to
   continually reinvent itself in the constantly evolving everyday urban
   jungle, while retaining is roots firmly in the history of a region. In
   a nutshell, street food has freed itself from prejudice and reclaimed
   its rightful place in the sun as an expression of culinary
   civilisation.

   loves it and can relish it irrespective of their financial status. Rich
   or poor, people just can’t get enough of it. Every day hundreds of

   people of different cultures and races sharing and bonding over the
   richness of their food. It is through the mouth that the goodness of

   captivates everyone!

   The global street food culture passes the message that we are bound
   together by one of the best things in life – food!

3. Street Food lets you taste authentic global cuisines

   Many street food vendors are cooks dishing out authentic delicacies
   from their regions and serve humble versions of authentic global
   cuisines that are sold exclusively at pricey restaurants and are
   otherwise unaffordable.

   So, you get to taste many authentic cuisines at throwaway prices. Of
   course there will be a difference in the ingredients used and the
   richness of taste that you get in expensive restaurants, but you need
   to remember that authentic food is not like what you taste in expensive
   restaurants.

   Over time, restaurants around the world have experimented with the
   cuisines adding or subtracting ingredients and coming up with unique
   rich flavours.

   However authentic street food cuisines are food items in their original
   and raw forms and hence cannot taste like their modified versions. So
   don’t be disappointed if you don’t find the buttered versions. Enjoy
   the originality of the foods in the simplicity they were discovered in.

   Street food is authentic in a lot of ways, one being the originality it
   is cooked with and the person cooking it without the thought of
   competing with others.

4. Street food consumption helps support local families &amp; individuals

   20 benefits or advantages of eating street food Many local families
   across the world earn their living by selling street food. (Photo by
   Matthieu Joannon on Unsplash).

   Many street food carts and stalls are run by local people who have no
   other form of employment or are not earning enough from their small
   jobs. There are many struggle stories in most such businesses.

   By eating at a street food cart or stall, you not just satisfy your
   hunger and save money, but also help many families earn a living and
   make ends meet.

   Street food is a two-way relationship where you benefit by getting
   cheap and good food on your plate and in return, help put food on the
   plates of many such people who run street food businesses.

   So you see, eating at a street food cart is also some form of social
   work on a local level.

5. Street food binds local communities together

   It is a fact that street food around the world has brought together
   local communities who share more than just common food but also their
   fears, joys, sadness, triumphs, concerns and much more.

   In many places around the world, local communities and their daily
   lives have been affected positively by their street food cultures that
   bring together people in unison.

   Eating together brings people close and allows them to strive for one
   another in every possible manner. Food induces a general feeling of
   belonging and oneness and that is what brings and binds communities.

   The many community food events are proof that every community cherishes
   eating together as a family.

   In other words, street food brings together strangers and makes them
   part of a bigger family!

6. Street food provides many indirect job opportunities

   20 benefits or advantages of eating street food Many food bloggers and
   vloggers earn a living out of street food blogs and vlogs. (Photo by
   Markus Winkler on Unsplash).

   Street food across the world provides work options to may food
   bloggers, vloggers and photographers who earn a living out of it. There
   is a thriving community of such people who depend on street food for
   work.

   You must have seen many street food videos yourself or read some
   articles in a food blog.

   Street food bloggers and vloggers on the other hand bring in more
   business for global street food markets in the form of tourists who are
   inspired by their food articles and videos.

   There are hundreds of thousands of food blogs and Youtube food channels
   that keep millions of food lovers around the world inspired and hungry.

7. Street food drives tourism across the world

   Global tourism is driven by the street food culture to a huge extent
   and there is no denying it. There is an increasing number of global
   travellers who have been travelling only to be able to eat the variety
   of street food that they read about in their favourite food blogs or
   watch on their many popular Youtube food channels.

   The fact is, that the global street food scenario has helped many
   countries draw in more and more tourists from around the world every
   year. People have been eating street food more than ever before.

   Street food tourism is a major part of all global travel now and hence
   it has been supporting and boosting the economy of many small and big
   countries. As a matter of fact there are many countries and cities
   around the world that depend extensively on tourism – street food is a
   boon for all of them.

8. Street food is a boon for office goers, especially bachelors

   20 benefits or advantages of eating street food Street food provides
   many office goers with their daily breakfast and lunch. (Photo by Shane
   Rounce on Unsplash).

   Street food helps hundreds of thousands of office goers who would
   otherwise miss breakfast or even lunch owing to time issues or not
   having someone to cook for them.

   Street food carts allow office goers to grab a quick bite in the
   morning or a wholesome plate of tasty and affordable lunch or dinner.

   Many bachelors depend on street food besides tiffin services for not
   just breakfast but also lunch and dinner.

   While tiffin service is a good option for getting home-cooked food it
   tends to clash with the schedules of office goers, especially
   bachelors, as corporate lives are unpredictable and many times people
   end up eating outside. As a result a lot of food delivered by tiffin
   goes to waste and so does the money spent on buying it.

   Street food, on the other hand, provides office goers and bachelors the
   flexibility to eat as and when required and save money too.

9. Street food carts are boons for young lovers

   Street food markets and hubs provide young lovers cheap and tasty food
   options to relish with their dates. There is no need to explain why
   young lovers or couples would depend on street food for anything from a
   small snack to lunch or dinner dates too.

   The young crowd, especially those who are still in college or working
   as interns, have minimal to no income at all and there is little pocket
   money to support eating out at expensive restaurants or cafes. Street
   food markets and hubs allow such people to eat a variety of tasty food
   and that too at throwaway prices.

   Many love stories have been born and grown at street food carts and
   continue to do so.

10. Street food provides breakfast to many homes

   It would surprise you to know that many households depend on street
   food carts for their breakfast every day. There are many families in
   major cities who don’t find enough time to cook breakfast in the
   mornings for several reasons. It could be simply because of lack of
   time, rotating work shifts that end during the wee hours, lethargy or
   simply the urge to eat a variety of snacks in the morning.

   It is just not possible for such people to prepare breakfast and hence
   street food stalls provide them with healthy, homely and cheaply priced
   food options.

   From light breakfasts like idli, vada, poha and upama to some heavy and
   spicy food items like dosa chhole-bhature, vada-pav, samosa,
   gobi-manchurian etc. street food has everything to offer to the hungry.

   It is a fact that a majority of the families with working individuals,
   depend on street food carts and stalls for their daily breakfasts.

11. Street food is a cheap and safe food option for hitchhikers

   Hundreds of thousands of people hitchhike every day around the world
   and almost every one of them travels on a tight budget. And why not?
   Hitchhiking is all about travelling around and living on minimum
   expense and that includes eating cheap too while also ensuring that it
   is safe.

   Street food provides a variety of cheap, safe and delicious food to
   hitchhikers and that is why they depend heavily on street food carts
   and stalls.

   As you know that a majority of hitchhikers don’t travel to eat at
   expensive restaurants or hotels, irrespective of their financial
   standings. They want to eat local and authentic and what else than
   street food to fulfil their wish? Also, the availability of popular
   street food carts ensure that they are eating healthy food and will not
   fall sick while touring.

12. Street food is a mental booster for many people

   Street food affects people’s minds a whole lot of positive ways. The
   taste, smell and feeling of something particular or everything cooked
   on the street have been said to boost the morale of many who throng the
   streets daily, livening them up and even warding off depression.

   Street food can fill you up with positive feelings and the assurance of
   a better time ahead. And it does not limit itself to those who eat it
   street food on a day to day basis but even those who simply walk by
   such food carts experiencing the goodness of street food from a
   distance.

   For many living alone in major cities for work, away from their
   families, a whiff of something cooked on the streets that reminds them
   of the food cooked at home by their mothers, sisters of wives, can make
   them feel at home. Though the still miss being at home, the smell and
   taste of street food resembling some part of the food prepared at their
   homes can be very assuring at times.

   Frankly, street food provides nothing less than a fair dose of
   aromatherapy, to promote health and well-being. Many people, including
   us, are firm believers that the smell of certain food can help improve
   the health of the body, mind, and spirit of people. Street food tends
   to latch itself to emotions and it is a known fact that emotions
   control the mental health of people and hence it controls the physical
   health too.

13. Street food is better than modern junk food

   Many think that street food is junk food but it is not. As a matter of
   fact, fast food is the real junk food in every sense. You see, fast
   food has been proved to be more harmful than anything that gets cooked
   and sold on the streets.

   Street food is food cooked on the streets in different authentic ways
   but fast food or junk food is food that has many processed food
   ingredients that cause long term health issues, it eaten daily.

   It is not the case with street food and on the contrary it can be eaten
   regularly as it has all the goodness that healthy staple diets provide.
   Why? Well because it is homely food simply cooked or served on the
   streets for business.

   Now many would debate but look at the growth in obesity and other
   ailments in people who eat fast food on a day to day in many developed
   countries.

   To be frank, there is hardly any processed food ingredients in street
   food and hence it is better than junk food.

   However, you should always consider the pros and cons of eating street
   food before eating out.

14. Street food hubs are happening venues of sorts

   Most street food markets or hubs build a very vibrant atmosphere around
   them. There is an increased amount of liveliness and positive vibes at
   such places. Depending on the local demography, there could be music,
   people having fun and joking about things, street performers playing
   instruments, dancing, singing or doing acts they are good at,
   youngsters exuding their no-worries attitude, small children,
   especially toddlers making faces amused by all that is transpiring
   around them and a lot more.

   Street food hubs are nothing less than entertaining hubs costing you
   nothing extra at all. So while you are eating different varieties of
   street food, you get to see people going about with their daily lives
   or discussing their problems and solutions. You get to partake in the
   triumphs of many, learn about different things that can add value to
   your lives or simply enjoy it all.

15. Street food is cheap food and pretty affordable

   Street food is cheap and easily affordable and you must know it. Every
   article ever written about street food emphasises on the fact that it
   is cheap. Even we have said that a couple of times here and there.

   The fact is, what makes street food more alluring is that it is cheap
   and can be afforded by just about everyone. You don’t need to be filthy
   rich to eat street food. As a matter of fact even those who are still
   searching for jobs, enjoy street food without any constraints.

   But don’t let the cheap prices of street food fool you. The low prices
   don’t mean that the quality of food is always questionable. Yes, every
   now and then, there comes news about some street food vendor messing up
   the trust of his patrons owing to sheer neglect and unconcern. But
   trust us such incidents are not rare even in a grade restaurants. It’s
   just you don’t get to hear it more often.

   Anyway, back to the point – street food allows you to eat good and
   tasty food without burning a hole in your pocket.

16. Street food has a variety to choose from

   Street food has a lot of variety to choose from and you can be spoiled
   for choice. Walk around any street food market or hub and you will see
   mouth-watering dishes lined up for your perusal.

   There is always a lot to choose from in street food owing to the fact
   that there are people from diverse cultures selling popular food from
   their regions. So you have different food items at your service.

   There is so much street food in the world to eat that it would take
   years if you were to eat just one dish each day.

   Also, for hoggish eaters, street food allows then to eat as many
   varieties of food as they can eat owing to their cheap prices. So they
   don’t have to think much about money while eating but rather their
   capacity to eat.

17. Street food hubs and corners are social network areas

   20 benefits or advantages of eating street food Street food markets or
   hubs help grow a healthy social network of like-minded people. (Photo
   by Peter Hall on Unsplash).

   Street food corners or hubs are good for socializing and networking
   with like-minded individuals as they all converge together for one
   common cause – food!

   There is nothing more fruitful than having a satisfying meal while
   discussing things that matter to us or seem interesting. Corporate
   meetings over lunch and dinner are proof that food paves way for
   healthy and fruitful discussions.

   Street food brings people of different mind sets and thinking and helps
   them with dissemination of knowledge and much more.

   There is a growing network of food lovers across the world who converge
   at street food festivals where they not only enjoy or talk about food,
   but also discuss about how other major issues of the world can be
   solved.

18. Most street food carts and stalls sell good quality food

   Street food carts are majorly run by owners who cook the food
   themselves. So is street food of good quality? Yes, it is. As a matter
   of fact street food is mostly good in quality as the owners aim to get
   loyal customers who last a long time.

   So most of the times you get street food as good as home-cooked food.
   You get to eat food that reminds you of food cooked at home because it
   is being prepared by people like us in a manner we all tend to cook at
   home.

   To be precise, most of the street food vendors cook the same food for
   both business and home. So they eat the same food that they sell at
   their food carts. That assures that the food is of good quality in
   every sense as they eat it themselves.

   There can be exceptions at times where some irresponsible street food
   vendors cut corners to earn extra profits. However, they are easy to
   detect and should be avoided at all costs.

   You can refer to this article to ensure that you are eating at the
   right street food cart or stall: Street food: 8 Things to take care of

The History of Street Food

   Street food culture has been around for millenia. It’s been sustaining
   the masses in major cities since urbanisation drove many people to find
   work in city centres. To this day, it still serves that purpose with
   densely populated cities like Bangkok, Tokyo and Singapore being the
   street food capitals of the world. Versions of this street food exist
   all over the globe and they’re constantly changing and adapting to suit
   the needs of the people they serve. We explore the multicultural and
   diverse history of street food and how this trend takes shape in South
   Africa today.
   [street-food-4x6-1.jpg]
   [street-food-4x6-2.jpg]

What is Street Food?

   Street food is, well, food served on the street. It’s typically served
   from food trucks, carts, hatches or even tables in major city centres
   where foot traffic is high and constant. It serves people who are
   on-the-go and need a quick lunch or dinner, but it also serves those
   who don’t have fully equipped home kitchens. In densely populated
   cities, where residential living space is dwindling, working class
   families often live in very small apartments that don’t have space for
   a kitchen. Street food is sometimes cheaper and more accessible
   compared to buying groceries, and has become common practice for people
   to rely on vendors for daily sustenance.

     Street food is the people’s food, originating from a need to feed
     the working class who couldn’t afford expensive cuisine or
     ingredients.

   In Singapore, street food is mostly served in ‘hawker centres’ which
   are large complexes, occupied by tables and dozens of street food
   vendor hatches. Hawker centres are known to have some of Singapore’s
   tastiest and cheapest food, and many people and families eat there
   everyday. Hawker culture is such an important part of the Singaporean
   way of life that on the 16th of December 2020, it was inscribed on the
   UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of
   Humanity.

     Street food is sometimes cheaper and more accessible compared to
     buying groceries, and has become common practice for people to rely
     on vendors for daily sustenance.

   These days, pretty much any type of meal can be served as street food.
   It’s no longer just meats and salads wrapped in bread, like shawarma,
   or food served on sticks. Some of the most popular street food dishes
   include aloo chaat from Northern India, bahn mi from Northern Vietnam,
   crepes from France, tacos from Mexico and mango sticky rice from
   Bangkok, to name the bare minimum. Street food has become so popular —
   there are several Netflix shows dedicated to documenting the history of
   street food and many more YouTube series highlighting everyday cooks
   who feed the hungry masses. These dishes have become ingrained in
   global food culture that often we aren’t even aware that the dish we
   are eating originated on the street in vendors’ carts.

The People’s Food

   Street food is the people’s food, originating from a need to feed the
   working class who couldn’t afford expensive cuisine or ingredients.
   Nowadays, street food serves to preserve indigenous food cultures
   around the world and vendors can often serve as welcome reminders of
   ‘home’ for those living in foreign cities. In countries like South
   Africa, where there are many cultural groups living in diaspora, some
   of the most popular street food vendors are those making dishes that
   draw inspiration from their cultural heritage and upbringing in South
   Africa.

     During the Apartheid era, when people of colour weren’t allowed to
     sit at restaurants, bunny chow was also a popular way of serving a
     takeaway option.

   The bunny chow, for example, is one of South Africa’s most popular
   street food dishes and it originated in Durban, during the 1940s. Many
   people were brought over from India as indentured labourers and they
   had to find a way of transporting their curries to and from work every
   day. White bread was the cheapest and most accessible bread and so, in
   order to transport their food efficiently, it was hollowed out and used
   as a type of ‘bowl’. During the Apartheid era, when people of colour
   weren’t allowed to sit at restaurants, bunny chow was also a popular
   way of serving a takeaway option (usually out of the back door of the
   kitchen).

A Window to the Past

   Learning about the history of street food culture is an amazing way to
   learn more about the history of a country and the people who have and
   are inhabiting it. Food is one of the few constants that have travelled
   with us over time. We can often gain insight into the way people lived,
   and why, by understanding what cuisines were available to them.

Information

   Indian street food is sold by hawkers from portable market stalls.
   Street food is common all over India, and people from all economic
   classes eat on the roadside almost round the clock and it is sometimes
   felt that the taste of street food is better than restaurants.

   Many Indians like a small snack on the road in the evening. People
   across barriers of class, religion, gender and ethnicity are passionate
   about street food. Street food is relatively inexpensive as compared to
   restaurants and vendors tend to be clustered around crowded areas such
   as colleges and railway stations. Text from Wikipedia.

   would be different from your mother’s, then this article is for you.

   When you are out of country, you need some hints not to get lost in the
   variety of tastes and flavors. We will give you a list of stories not
   only about best destinations for food, but also about how to understand
   what is on your plate. What are the must-eats and must-drinks? And what
   you should avoid not to get into awkward situations…

   Which are the Best Countries in the World for Food? Let’s start! Don’t
   get overexcited though, this list is not a rating- it’s just a
   collection of delicious destinations!

   The main ingredients of Vietnamese food include shrimp paste, fish
   sauce, rice, herbs, Thai basil, fruits and vegetables. But at the same
   time, unlike other Asian countries, Vietnam has one of the healthiest
   foods in this region.

       pork, shrimp or crab.
     * Banh mi – sandwich with vegetables, omelette and various different
       fillings.

   There are many things in general you can try, from salads to hot
   dishes, from sweets to soups. But if you want something traditional,
   cheap and fast – it`s definitely souvlaki. The iconic dish of Greece is
   a fast food that you usually can find anywhere on the streets, in the
   bars, in small take-out shops and cafes. You will see souvlaki over the
   whole country. And if you are lucky enough to be invited to a house
   party of Greek people – ask for mousaka. It is the best when it`s
   homemade.

   A little glossary for a newbie:
     * Greak salad – it is called just «salad» in Greece. Be aware of this
       when you order in restaurant.
     * Souvlaki – “Little skewers” in Greek: it`s basically little pieces
       of marinated pork, fried on grill.
     * Mousaka – is an eggplant- or potato-based dish. You definitely
       would want to give it a try.
     * Must-Drink in Greece: ouzo, tsipouro

     * Remember: you wouldn’t want to seem odd in the nightclub – so don’t
       order Tsipouro there. Leave it for quiet evenings in mountains. And
       don’t be silly, don’t order GREEK salad.

   It’s hard to speak about Italian food, it’s better to enjoy it. The
   traditional colors of Italian cuisine – red, green and yellow always
   create a great mixture of flavor and taste. Usually all the dishes are
   based on tomato, bread and olive oil. The secret of the cuisine is not
   in a sophisticated preparation process, it is more in the freshness of
   the products.

   A little glossary for a newbie:
     * Pizza – Margherita, Quattro Formaggi, Speck e Mascarpone &amp; many
       more…
     * Pasta – choose Pesto (from Italian Riviera) or Cacio &amp; pepe and
       Amatriciana (from Rome): these are the best options.
     * Caprese – ask for it just if the ingredients are: original
       mozzarella di bufala, “Cuor di Bue” tomato &amp; Extra virgin Olive
       oil. With a slice of Italian fresh bread, it’s a simple and amazing
       dish.
     * Panna cotta – a creamy dessert made of heaven, usually served with
       red-berry jam.
     * Must-Drink in Italy: Red Wine (Barbaresco, Barolo, Brunello di
       Montalicino &amp; many more…), White wine (Gewürztraminer, Muller
       Thurgau, Chardonnay, Vermentino, Arneis &amp; many more…), Sparkling
       wine (Franciacorta &amp; Prosecco), limoncello, San Pellegrino water.

   Like many other Asian cuisines, Thai cooking uses rice as a basic
   ingredient for the majority of dishes. The word “food” in Thai language
   means literally “to eat rice”. Furthermore, it has 5 main tastes, which
   you may meet in almost every dish. These are: sour lime, savory fish
   sauce, hot chilli, salt and sweetness (usually added by palm tree).

       chilli, coco, shrimps and cream

   Japanese food is one of a kind. You will never mistake it. Sushi,
   sashimi, unagi, and sake… we all know this. But this cuisine is not
   only about products and recipes, here a lot is about their indigenous
   culture and traditions. It is not surprising then that they made the
   whole world eat with chopsticks instead of knives and forks.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Tempura – the Japanese contribution to the world’s love for
       deep-fried foods.
     * Wagashi – sweets, made of red bean paste
     * Unagi – eel
     * Soba and Udon – types of Noodles
     * Tonkatsu – deep-fried pork cutlets
     * Must-Drink in Japan: Yakitori beer, Sake, Tea

   Usually the Japanese serve their food with traditional rice wine –
   sake. It actually tastes more like vodka than wine. What is more – it
   is usually served hot. Be careful when the waiter brings you sake –
   don’t attack it like you’ve just stumbled out of a month in the desert.
   Drink slowly and carefully.
     * Remember: When someone starts to pour you a drink, you should hold
       your glass with both hands and thank him or her.

   It’s all about extremely fat and therefore enormously tasty foods.
   Various pastries, soups, meat dishes and unexpected mixture of tastes –
   you may find all these in Ukrainian cuisine.

   The famous Russian beetroot soup, borsch, actually comes from Ukrainian
   cuisine. Ukrainian borsch is a little bit different than the Russian
   one, but you will hardly notice. Anyways – it rocks.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Borsch – a meat-beetroot soup, made with everything that was found
       in the fridge.

       cabbage, cottage cheese or cherry.

   It is not a coincidence that you will find Chinese food pretty much
   everywhere. But remember, there are 2 types of Chinese cuisine –
   authentic and fake. How to identify the first type? Easy. If you are in
   China – it’s all over. If you are in your city’s Chinese restaurant –
   choose the place where customers are Chinese, not tourists.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Soy puff – enormously tasteless piece of “bread”, which thought
       will help you not to suffer from all the spicy hot dishes.
     * Tofu – another tasteless food, it is a soy cheese. But when it’s
       fried with spices – nothing`s better.
     * Noodles – they could be made of pretty much anything. Be ready for
       this, and be curious – all these usually taste like heaven.
     * Bird’s nest soup: it is the soup that has been prepared with the
       gelatinous product derived from the nests of cliff-dwelling birds.
       You can imagine, it has a very unusual taste. You should only try
       it if you have extra money to order something as a plan “B”.
     * Chop suey – not only a song by System of A Down. It is also a
       stir-fried dish with meat or shrimps and vegetables (mushrooms,
       water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts). It is usually served
       on rice.
     * Must-Drink in China: Tea or any Chinese beer.

   As we remember, the cow is a sacred animal here and the majority of
   Indians are vegetarians. Traditional Indian food uses many different
   spices and is slathered with  flavourful sauce. They are also big fans
   of Indian homemade white cheese, called Panir. Every dish is
   traditionally accompanied by naan bread. Of course, rice is one of the
   basic products of Indian cuisine as well.

   Concerning alcohol – you would not find it anywhere in India, almost
   nowhere. Only Goa is famous for parties and drinks, because there is no
   alcohol tax here, unlike all other states of India.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Paneer Butter Masala – it’s the most popular dish in India, you may
       find it anywhere. It is made of tomato puree with cream and the
       traditional Indian herbs and spices.
     * Aloo Gobi – a side dish, made of potato and cauliflower.
     * Must-Drink in India: Masala Tea, Kingfisher beer, Old Monk rum.

     * Remember: Drink only bottled water and it’s better to eat when the
       food is cooked in front of you. Just in case.

       In Montenegro we like “kačamak”. Polenta, mentioned in your text,
       is not used very much, though made of almost the same ingredients,
       Tourist should try also “cicvara”.

                 Hello,
                 Your comments in Spanish food seems very turist and
                 foreign, I believe you didnt travel to much in Spain.
                 First of all you forgot about the wine, secondly is very
                 groument school, spain is a manufacture agriculture of
                 food products so please your comments from Spain food are
                 very poor.

            Xana, good evening!
            Thank you for your comment!
            But I am pretty sure that zrazi are made of meat (I had
            private consultations with 2 Ukrainians :). Don’t you mix it
            up with draniki? 🙂 If not – tell me more about “zrazi made of
            potato”, I can not wait to hear about it!

                 But zrazi really are made of potato. fried potato patties
                 with different kind of fillings: meat (usually pork or
                 beef), cabbage (I think it is more traditional),
                 mushrooms, cabbage with mushrooms, eggs with onion and so
                 on.

                      That sounds more like what we call kartoplyannyky.
                      Although i think some regions might call it zrazy,
                      but original zrazy are actually from meat with
                      various stuffing.

                           names,in Lviv they will say pirogi(in general

                           but you can say meat zrazi and it will be the
                           one that was written in the artical. So it can
                           be left this way.

       Borsch is made not of everything you find in the frindge!
       Obligatory ingredients include cabbage, onion, carrot, potatao,
       oil, water, salt, black pepper, plus additionally beet (to make the
       borsch red) and meat can be added. You can eat it with souer cream

       Gorilka – homemade Ukrainian vodka. Strong as hell.
       Of course, as gorilka came from “burn” not “water”!
       Zrazi – beef cutlets with different fillings.
       ZrazY! No beef at all! ZrazY its a dish made from grated POTATOS!

            I am happy that you commented. Now we know, that in some

            curious, we never heard of it before…
            Talking about borsch – it is sometimes called Russian, because
            in foreigners’ minds it’s usually associated with this
            country. And for centuries Russians really cook Borsch very
            often (even though it was invented in Ukraine).

       I don’t know where you took this information from, but I’m mexican
       and I’ve never seen chilli con carne on the menu of a restaurant in
       Mexico, I’ve only seen it outside the country and I guess that it
       is a Tex-Mex dish, which is different than Mexican food. Also,
       tacos are not crispy corn chips, I think you wanted to say nachos.
       Finally, enchiladas are nothing like lasagna, they are not made out
       of pasta, they are made out of tortillas, they don’t include beef
       or vegetables, they have chicken or cheese inside the tortillas,
       and they are supposed to be covered with a spicy sauce made out of
       chiles not tomatos.

                      Actually I know about WTA, but my article was not

       You should probably remove India from your list. Because everything

       How do you get the ingredients wrong on a Caesar salad? It’s not
       iceberg lettuce, it’s romaine. Romaine, parmesan, croutons, and
       Caesar dressing. Chicken only comes if it’s a whole meal. Maybe
       cherry tomatoes.
       But saying iceberg lettuce makes me skeptical about this entire
       list.

       be in the top five with Thai, Indian, Chinese, and Italian. Of
       course, that is just my personal preference.

       Interesting article. However, ur way off regarding the
       vegetarianism and alcohol part. There r few dry states but
       everywhere else its legally available. The difference is the
       restrictions regarding its sale. For example, u won’t find it in
       regular grocery stores or departmental stores but u will find it
       designated liquor stores. Also statistically 40% of indians r
       vegeterian. And in must try u should also mention non veg dishes
       like butter chicken, hyderabadi biryani. Tandoori chicken which u
       attributed to Pakistan originated and widely available in India.

       Every country has a rich culinary history and can offer foreign

       fussy or a food-snob of sorts, you should be able to get a good
       meal just about anywhere in the world. All countries have fresh
       fruits and vegetables, grilled meats, rice, starches, noodles,
       breads, salads, desserts, sweets and so on. Albeit in various
       different forms, cooked in different ways, served in different
       sauces and prepared with often strange and exotic condiments and
       spices. That is the beauty of travelling abroad and far and wide.
       If you are not willing to try and explore foreign foods and try
       experience local dishes, what is the point of travelling in the

       Pljeskavica ain’t Montenegrin cuisine, it’s purely Serbian,
       although Montenegro people are practically Serbs. In fact,
       Pljeskavica’s national dish of Serbia and, yes, you may check it
       out yourself.
       Also, your blog only lists countries which you may’ve visited. I
       know that a lot of Russians go to Montenegro each year so it’s no
       wonder, but not staying at Serbia and eating Serbian food is a
       serious loss. You should take at least 2 weeks in order to travel
       Serbia and stay in Vojvodina as well as Zlatibor and Leskovac.
       First of all it’s the best BBQ ever made on the planet Earth. Only
       Argentinian BBQ comes close to it.
       Second of all, Serbia’s cuisine is one of the richest cuisines in
       the world offering a huge variety for anyone who’s into gastronomy.
       Montenegro can’t really relive that sense made in Serbia.
       Here’s a deal, just google Serbian food or Serbian meze or Serbian
       breakfast or whatever comes to your mind ranging from river-fish up
       to the full-scale roasted pig or lamb. It’s a huge deal in Serbia.
       Next deal is – meet Serbian people and bond up to the point where
       you can go and visit a specific sort of a deal – SLAVA. Yes,
       slava’s the epitome of the Serbian gastronomical experience based
       on the religious views of Orthodox Christianity and is a must to
       visit.
       Another deal – check the youtube videos of the particular
       individual called Charles Cather and see what he talks about
       Serbian cuisine.

       Hello Anastasia!
       I am from India and I am a little disappointed in how you’ve
       portrayed India.
       More than half the population here is non-vegetarian. I don’t think
       you’ve tried a lot of dishes if you’re calling paneer butter masala
       the most popular dish in India. It is popular, yes, but not the
       most popular. You should try pani puri (also called golgappa),
       idlis, dosas, samosas, malai kofta, palak paneer, avial, dal
       makhni, paneer tikka, dhokla, and a long list of others in the
       vegetarian end. For your non-vegetarian side, you could try the
       Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani, and Egg Biryani, made of basmati
       rice and that define the city of Hyderabad in the country.
       I don’t know if you think that the food here is unclean but that is
       a huge, glaring misconception that is being spread about my
       country.
       Please do some research before resorting to unnecessary mudslinging
       on a beautiful, beautiful country!
       No offense meant! 🙂

       Around 35% of indians are vegetarians. The rest aren’t. It’s common
       to assume India to be a vegetarian country, but that’t far from the

       vegetarians compared to any other country, and that’s about it.

       not just Istanbul, the entire country which hosted 100s of

       Majority of the Indians are Vegetarians? Almost every dish is
       accompanied by naan bread? Alcohol is not available in India except
       Goa? WTF?
       Majority of the Indians (i.e. 75%) are non-vegetarians. Naan bread
       is popular in Northern part of India. In the South it is not part
       of our culture. I cannot think of a city or town that doesn’t have
       Alcohol in India except for the state of Bihar where alcohol is
       banned.

       You have done a valuable job, but food taste is very subjective and
       I believe Persian cuisine is absolutely missing or Turkish cuisine
       as well. Greek kitchen (Turkish kitchen is smaller size) is derived
       from turkish one during otteman empire based on historical facts.
       Thank you for what you have done.

       You cannot find alcohol almost anywhere in India!! lolz. I think
       you have not visited India real well. May be some of us are

       mention the sumptuous non veg dishes we have like lamb/chicken

Street food

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to navigation Jump to search
   Ready-to-eat food or drink on a street

   Street food in New York City
   Street food in Yangon Chinatown, Myanmar

   Street food is ready-to-eat food or drinks sold by a hawker, or vendor,
   in a street or at other public places, such as markets or fairs. It is
   often sold from a portable food booth,^[1] food cart, or food truck and
   is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but
   many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are
   classified as both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper
   than restaurant meals. The types of street food widely vary between
   regions and cultures in different countries around the world.^[2]
   According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization,
   2.5 billion people eat street food every day.^[3] A majority of
   middle-income consumers^[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service
   of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in
   developing countries.

   Today, governments and other organizations are increasingly concerned
   with both the socioeconomic importance of street food, and with its
   associated risks. These risks include food safety, sanitation issues,
   illegal use of public or private areas, social problems and traffic
   congestion.^[4]

History[edit]

   Satay street vendor in Java, Dutch East Indies, c. 1870, using pikulan
   or carrying baskets using a rod
   The presence of street food vendors in New York City throughout much of
   its history, such as these circa 1906, are credited with helping
   support the city's rapid growth.

Europe[edit]

   In ancient Greece, small fried fish was a street food,^[5] however, the
   Greek philosopher Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low
   regard.^[6] Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was
   discovered during the excavation of Pompeii.^[7] Street food was widely
   consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes
   did not have ovens or hearths.^[8] Chickpea soup^[9] with bread and
   grain paste^[10] were common meals. In ancient China, street food
   generally catered to the poor, though wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their
   homes.^[8]

   A travelling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in
   Cairo, people brought picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the
   streets and sit on while they ate their meals of lamb kebabs, rice, and
   fritters they purchased from street vendors.^[11] In Renaissance
   Turkey, many crossroads had vendors selling "fragrant bites of hot
   meat," including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted.^[11] In
   1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and
   standardize street food.^[12]

   In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold
   gingerbread nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other
   meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside.^[13] French
   fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a
   street food in Paris in the 1840s.^[14] Street foods in Victorian
   London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and
   jellied eels.^[15]

Americas[edit]

   Aztec marketplaces had vendors who sold beverages such as atolli ("a
   gruel made from maize dough"), almost 50 types of tamales (with
   ingredients that ranged from the meat of turkey, rabbit, gopher, frog
   and fish to fruits, eggs and maize flowers),^[16] as well as insects
   and stews.^[17] Spanish colonization brought European food stocks like
   wheat, sugarcane and livestock to Peru, but most commoners continued to
   primarily eat their traditional diets. Imports were only accepted at
   the margins of their diet, for example, grilled beef hearts sold by
   street vendors.^[18] Some of Lima's 19th-century street vendors such as
   "Erasmo, the 'negro' sango vendor" and Na Aguedita are still remembered
   today.^[19]

   During the American Colonial period, "street vendors sold oysters,
   roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes."
   Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until
   around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise.^[20]
   Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After
   previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food
   vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707.^[21] Many
   women of African descent made their living selling street foods in
   America in the 18th and 19th centuries, with products ranging from
   fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines and
   other sweets in New Orleans.^[22] Cracker Jack started as one of many
   street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.^[23]

Asia[edit]

   Rocket Festival in Thailand

   The selling of street food in China stretches back millennia and became
   an integral part of Chinese food culture during the Tang Dynasty.
   Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with
   regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary
   tourism.^[24] Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has
   had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced
   the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street
   food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers
   imported from China during the late 19th century.^[25]

   Ramen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100
   years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However,
   it soon became a "national dish" and even acquired regional
   variations.^[26]

   Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of
   Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the
   early 1960s,^[27] when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the
   street food culture, and by the 1970s it had "displaced
   home-cooking."^[28] As a result, many Thai street foods are derived
   from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine.^[29] About 76% of urban
   residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of
   the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity
   of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone
   generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee,
   Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects
   the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually
   from 2020 forward.^[30] Multiple studies showed that contamination of
   food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the
   contamination at restaurants.^[31] An estimated 2% or 160,000 vendors
   provide street food for Bangkok's 8 million people.^[32]

   In Delhi, India, it is said that ugh kings used to visit the kebab
   vendors on the street, which you can still visit to this day. During
   the colonial times, fusion street food was created, which was made with
   British customers in mind.^[33]

   In Indonesia — especially Java, traveling food and drink vendors have a
   long history, as they were described in temples bas reliefs dated from
   9th century, as well as mentioned in 14th century inscription as a line
   of work. In Indonesia, street food is sold from carts and bicycles.
   During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several
   street food were developed and documented, including satay and dawet
   (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's
   vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization
   in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service
   sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban
   agglomerations, especially in Greater Jakarta, Bandung and
   Surabaya.^[34] Some cultures consider rude walking on the street while
   eating.^[31]

   Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly
   between regions and cultures.^[2]

   Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being "fresh
   and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing]
   heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of
   Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste and fish
   sauce."^[35] Street food in Thailand offers a varied selection of
   ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks. The capital of Thailand,
   Bangkok, has been listed as one of the best places for street
   food.^[36]^[37] Popular street offerings in Bangkok include pad thai
   (stir fried rice noodle), green papaya salad, sour tom yum soup, Thai
   curries and mango sticky rice.

   Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese,
   and Dutch influences.^[38] Indonesian street food is often strongly
   flavored and spicy. Much of the street food in Indonesia is fried, such
   as fritters, nasi goreng and ayam goreng. Bakso (meatball soup), satay
   (skewered chicken) and gado-gado (vegetable salad served in peanut
   sauce) are also popular.^[39]

   There is a stigma in Japan against eating on the move. However, during
   special occasions such as festivals, the streets of Tokyo are filled
   with vendors that serve food such as odango, sashimi, oyster, and
   octopus.

   Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its
   own specialities to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes
   are vada pav, misal pav, chole bhature, parathas, bhel puri, sev puri,
   gol gappa, aloo tikki, kebabs, tandoori chicken, samosas, kachori,
   idli, pohe, egg bhurji, pav bhaji, pulaw, pakora, lassi, kulfi and
   falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly
   known as nukkadwala food ("corner" food). In South India, foods like
   mirchi bajji, punugulu, and mokkajonna (corn roasted on coal) are
   common street foods, along with breakfast items like idli, dosa and
   bonda. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to
   sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken their
   inspiration from the street food of India.^[40]
   Street food in Hyderabad, India

   In the Middle East falafel is very popular. Vendors sell it on street
   corners in Israel, Egypt, and Syria. Another food sold commonly on the
   street in Egypt is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish.^[41]

   In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passers-by to purchase sausages and
   hot dogs.

   In the Caribbean Islands a traditional dish is Jamaican jerk chicken.
   The original marinade calls for Caribbean ingredients such as scotch
   bonnet peppers, allspice berries and sometimes wood from laurel
   trees.^[42]
   Grilled bread with jam served with sweetened milk in Bangkok

   Mexican street food is known as antojitos (translated as "little
   cravings") and features several varieties of tacos, such as tacos al
   pastor, as well as huaraches and other maize based foods.

   New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, but New York
   street food also includes everything from spicy Middle Eastern falafel
   or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles ^[35]

   In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of "plate lunch" (rice,
   macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the
   Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.^[43]

Cultural and economic aspects[edit]

   Street vendor of snack foods in Nepal

   Because of differences in culture, social stratification, and history,
   the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally
   created and run vary in different areas of the world.^[44] Often,
   women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender
   equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street
   vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street
   food trade.^[45] Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes
   towards meals is one "cultural factor operating in the street food
   phenomenon" in the Philippines because eating "food out in the open, in
   the market or street or field" is "not at odds with the meal indoors or
   at home" where "there is no special room for dining".^[13]

   Other cultural phenomena that affect the street food market include the
   cultural implications of eating while walking down the street. In some
   cultures, this is considered to be rude,^[46] such as Japanese^[47] or
   Swahili cultures. Despite not being allowed for adults, it is
   culturally acceptable for children to do.^[48] In India, Henrike Donner
   wrote about a "marked distinction between food that could be eaten
   outside, especially by women," and the food prepared and eaten at home,
   with some non-Indian food being too "strange" or tied too closely to
   non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.^[49]

   In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce
   economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors
   purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the
   area have expanded.^[50] In the United States, street food vendors are
   credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying
   meals for the city's merchants and workers.^[51] Proprietors of street
   food in the United States have had a goal of upward mobility, moving
   from selling on the street to their own shops.^[52] However, in Mexico,
   an increase in street vendors has been seen as a sign of deteriorating
   economic conditions in which food vending is the only employment
   opportunity that unskilled labor who have migrated from rural areas to
   urban areas are able to find.^[17]

   In 2002, Coca-Cola reported that China, India, and Nigeria were some of
   its fastest-growing markets: markets where the company's expansion
   efforts included training and equipping mobile street vendors to sell
   its products.^[50]

   The libertarian Reason magazine states that in US cities, food trucks
   are subject to regulations designed to prevent them from competing with
   brick and mortar restaurants. For example, in Chicago, a regulation
   prevents food trucks "...from selling food within 200 feet of
   brick-and-mortar restaurants and, hence, prohibit them from operating
   throughout the city's downtown area," which critics have called an
   "anti-competitive" rule for food truck operators.^[53]

   Since 1984, Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco is home of one of the
   most diverse street food fairs.^[54] In addition to much leather, and
   people in various states of dress and undress, the event features an
   outdoor food court serving a variety of street food. For donations of
   $10 or more, visitors get a $2 discount on each drink purchased at the
   fair. In 2018, the street photographer Michael Rababy documented it in
   his book, Folsom Street Food Court.^[54]^[55]

   Netflix has also featured the street foods of the world through its TV
   series Street Food, with the first volume focusing on Asia, and the
   second on Latin America.^[56]^[57]^[58]

Health and safety[edit]

   As early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food
   vendor activities.^[11] With the increasing pace of globalization and
   tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns
   of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise
   public awareness.^[59]^[60]^[61] However, despite concerns about
   contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low,
   with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.^[43]

   In Singapore, street food vendors known as "hawkers", over half of
   which were unlicensed, were considered "primarily a nuisance to be
   removed from the streets".^[62] 113 hawker centres were constructed
   between 1971 and 1986 to remove hawkers from the streets while
   preserving the food culture.^[62]

   In 2002, a sampling of 511 street foods in Ghana by the World Health
   Organization showed that most had microbial counts within the accepted
   limits,^[63] and a different sampling of 15 street foods in Calcutta
   showed that they were "nutritionally well balanced", providing roughly
   200 kcal (Cal) of energy per rupee of cost.^[64]

   In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided
   comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and
   retailers of the street food sector since 2000.^[65] Other effective
   ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping
   programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing
   and membership management programs, and technical testing
   programs.^[66]^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]

   In India, government recognized the fundamental rights of the street
   food vendors and have imposed reasonable restrictions. And in 2006,
   India legislature has enacted the food Safety and Standards Act to
   monitor the quality of food.^[71]

   Despite knowledge of the risk factors, actual harm to consumers’ health
   is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in
   tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up
   studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and
   food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been
   devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness.
   The fact that social and geographical origins largely determine
   consumers’ physiological adaptation and reaction to foods—whether
   contaminated or not—is neglected in the literature.^[72]

   In the late 1990s, the United Nations and other organizations began to
   recognize that street vendors had been an underused method of
   delivering fortified foods to populations, and in 2007, the UN Food and
   Agriculture Organization recommended considering methods of adding
   nutrients and supplements to street foods that are commonly consumed by
   the particular culture.^[43]

Global Eats: The Rise of Indian Street Food

       Global Eats: The Rise of Indian Street Food

The flavors and ingredients of the street-food stalls found throughout India
are making their way onto U.S. restaurant menus.
       The vast culinary landscape of Indian street food is expanding
       throughout the United States in a variety of forms, from kati rolls
       and dosas to various spicy, flavorful snacks known as chaat.
       Americans have been building up an appetite for these foods, says
       Akash Kapoor, founder and CEO of Curry Up Now, the San Francisco
       restaurant chain that is adapting Indian foods in familiar forms
       such as burritos and also is offering traditional Indian
       street-food snacks. “What was once described as exotic is now a
       commonplace food, and overall there’s been a greater acceptance of
       ethnic food,” he says. “There is a homey, comfort factor with
       Indian food, and it intrigues many people because it’s different
       from other cuisines.”
       Indian street food varies widely from region to region, and even
       from vendor to vendor within regions. It can incorporate fried
       dough with or without fillings, is often made with a medley of
       vegetables, spices, and sauces, and can include a range of
       flavorful, seasoned meats. It can take the form of dumpling-like
       creations such as momos served with spicy chili paste, kebabs on or
       off the skewer, and a variety of sandwiches filled with flavors
       that are likely unfamiliar to most U.S. consumers.
       Chaat refers to the Indian street “snacks” that are usually built
       upon a crunchy base and topped with chickpeas, potatoes, onions
       and/or various other ingredients, often served with chutneys or an
       umami sauce called chaat masala.
       Research firm Datassential reports that chaat is listed on only 1.8
       percent of restaurant menus, up 3 percent since 2015 and up 30
       percent since 2009. Only 12 percent of consumers are familiar with
       it, and only 6 percent of consumers report having tried it.
       Chaat has its strongest presence on fine-dining menus, but has
       potential to grow, according to Cassandra Kaul, digital strategist
       at Datassential. “There’s an inherent flexibility to chaat that
       allows for creative takes and safe experimentation,” she says.
       Emerging Concepts
       Restaurant operators seeking to experiment with chaat or other
       Indian street foods will find no shortage of ideas emerging from
       the concepts dedicated to these foods that are appearing around the
       country. One such concept is Chaatable, a Memphis, Tenn.,
       restaurant opened last year by acclaimed chef Maneet Chauhan under
       her Morph Hospitality operating company.
       Chauhan, who is also known as a judge on the culinary TV show
       Chopped, says Chaatable strives to offer authentic Indian street
       foods in a vibrant environment that recalls the colorful street
       stalls of her home country. “The U.S. dining market as a whole is
       becoming very sophisticated and global,” she says. “Our guests at
       our other Nashville concepts let us know they were ready to try
       something beyond chicken tikka masala.”
       In developing the menu, Chauhan says she sought to “cover the major
       [protein] categories,” while giving customers an authentic Indian
       street-food experience. “At the end of the day we stayed authentic
       and true to traditional Indian street food because we knew it’s
       what customers wanted,” she says.
       The menu pulls flavors and ingredients from various Indian regions
       and is as fun and whimsical as the decor. Dishes include O.M. Ghee
       (ghee toasted cashews, curry leaves, and chaat masala) and Frankie
       Goes to Bollywood—a malai chicken or paneer parantha frankie (a
       type of wrap common in Mumbai), served with onion, tomato, and mint
       chutney. The best sellers on the menu have been the Build-a-Bhel (a
       puffed rice dish with choice of ingredients), Butter Chicken, and
       Samosas, says Chauhan.
       Some Indian street foods were deemed a little too eccentric for
       U.S. palates, however. Chauhan opted not to include bheja fry, for
       example, which is made with sautéed goat’s brain. “We thought that
       would be pushing the envelope a bit too much,” she says.
       Saucy and Spicy
       At Curry Up Now, which operates three food trucks and six
       company-owned restaurants (and recently began franchising as well),
       Kapoor seeks to infuse the menu with spice in more ways than one.
       “We didn’t want to do it the way it’s always been done,” he says.
       “We wanted to be sexy, naughty, and risqué while keeping the food
       authentic.”
       Menu items include Sexy Fries, which feature Curry Up Now’s own
       Indian-inspired poutine with cross-cut sweet potato fries, cheese,
       and paneer or chicken tikka masala; and The Naughty Naan, which is
       similar to a flatbread pizza, topped with caramelized onions,
       jalapeño, cheese, and paneer or chicken tikka masala.
       The company, which launched as a food truck in 2009, wanted to
       create its own variety of hand-held Indian street foods. It takes
       the relatively unfamiliar flavors of Indian cuisine and introduces
       them in more familiar hand-held forms such as burritos, tacos,
       quesadillas, pizza, and fries “to make it approachable for the
       everyday American consumer,” says Kapoor.
       The food is spicy, but not so much that it overpowers the dishes,
       he explains. “It’s spice-forward, but not ‘kick you in your gut’
       spicy. Spice doesn’t have to mean red chili powder that burns.
       Coriander, cumin, asafetida, turmeric, fennel, allspice, cloves,
       chili powder, etc., are all spices that we use in our food.”
       In addition to the burritos and bowls, the street-snack portion of
       the menu also generates a lot of consumer interest. These include a
       giant samosa known as ‘The Dude,” which is filled with chicken
       biryani and a sous-vide egg. Other items include Vada Pav, which is
       a slider-style sandwich common on the streets of Mumbai, and Pav
       Bhaji, a vegetable mash served with pav bread (an Indian bread
       roll).
       Curry Up Now’s burritos are made with a layer of rice on the
       tortilla, topped with chana garbanzo masala and a choice of
       protein, such as chicken tikka masala, ghee makhni butter paneer,
       or lamb. Kapoor says his personal favorite is the Hella Vegan
       burrito, which is a samosa inside a tortilla, and made like samosa
       chaat.
       The company’s Deconstructed Samosa is another popular item, made
       using the crispy skin of a traditional samosa, topped with layers
       of chana garbanzo masala, pico kachumber (an Indian salad made with
       cucumber and tomato), chutneys, mini samosas, and a choice of
       protein. “It’s a reimagined version of a traditional Indian street
       food, but with added layers and deeper flavor from the toppings,”
       says Kapoor, who describes it as a “party in your mouth
       experience.”
       Bridging the Gap
       In New York City, Deep Foods is bridging the gap between
       traditional Indian foods and consumer interest in Indian street
       foods at its restaurants. The company operates five Deep Indian
       Kitchen restaurant locations, all in Manhattan.
       “We are having tremendous success with the concept we are
       offering,” says Deepak Amin, president and CEO of Deep Foods, which
       is based in Union, N.J., and also operates a large CPG business
       supplying retail stores with Indian foods (see sidebar, p. 57). He
       says consumers are seeking flavorful foods in grab-and-go forms,
       whether it’s from food trucks or restaurants.
       The menu at Deep Indian Kitchen is divided into two parts, with the
       traditional Indian foods making up one portion of the offerings and
       the grab-and-go items the other. Both sides have been equally
       popular, Amin says.
       Among the grab-and-go items are kati rolls—which many people are
       already familiar with from Indian street cars in New York, along
       with dosa, which is a rice-based crepe that also happens to be
       gluten-free. Samosas, which often appear as an appetizer on Indian
       restaurant menus in the U.S., are also a popular grab-and-go food
       at the Deep Indian Kitchen restaurants, Amin says.
       The restaurants drive a strong lunch business, and aim to target
       “adventurous eaters,” generally in the 45-and-under age group, he
       adds.
       Deep Indian Kitchen is currently exploring the idea of adding a
       breakfast menu. “The cuisine has a lot of different [breakfast]
       options,” says Amin. “We are looking at what we can do with grab
       and go for breakfast.”
       Deep is also exploring opportunities to add more locations in New
       York City, and has a flagship restaurant under construction on its
       headquarters campus in New Jersey.
         ______________________________________________________________

       Retail Products Target Grab-and-Go Snackers
       Anshu Dua, co-founder and CEO of The Chaat Co., New York, is
       seeking to create the Sabra of Indian street foods.
       The startup is launching its products, a line of fresh Indian snack
       packs, into a limited number of retail stores, including some Whole
       Foods Market locations in the Northeast, and into some college and
       corporate foodservice grab-and-go retail displays. “When you look
       at what Sabra did with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean foods like
       hummus, babaganoush, etc., they basically took very ethnic foods
       and flavors and snack-ified them,” Dua says. “Twelve years ago,
       Americans had no clue what hummus was.”
       The Chaat Co.’s new snack-pack line includes popped chickpea chips
       with chaat masala, along with a variety of different Indian
       chutneys—tamarind, mango, coconut, and tomato. “These are inspired
       by flavors from different parts of India,” Dua says, noting that
       mango and tamarind are flavors typically used in northern India,
       while tomato reflects southern Indian cuisine.
       “You will find these chutneys as condiments for a variety of
       different types of street food in India,” says Dua. “We tried to
       capture many of the ingredients and the flavors from that, and
       created a snacking experience for Americans so they can experience
       Indian food like they never had before and in a whole new way
       versus the typical buffet line experience that most Americans have
       today.”
       Dua says the Indian foods many Americans have become familiar with
       through traditional, sit-down Indian restaurants were developed by
       an older generation of Indian entrepreneurs who were seeking to
       create menus that appealed to Indian-Americans with the comfort
       foods of their homeland.
       Now, he says, Indian food producers like himself are targeting a
       younger generation of consumers who enjoy experimenting with new
       flavors, and also enjoy snacking and sharing foods.
       Likewise, Deepak Amin, president and CEO of Union, N.J.-based Deep
       Foods, parent of the Tandoor Chef line of frozen Indian foods and
       the Deep Indian Kitchen restaurant chain in New York, says Deep
       Foods is looking to bring back more hand-held Indian street foods
       into its product line. “It’s all about grab-and-go items, and items
       that are full of flavor,” he says.
       The company is in the process of transitioning all its products to
       the Deep Indian Kitchen brand, which it has previously used for
       authentic foods targeting the Indian consumer market. “We are going
       back to our roots and offering all the different products we have
       under one umbrella,” says Amin. “As awareness is growing, we are
       seeing that all of the other [traditional Indian] offerings we have
       are becoming more relevant.” -- M.H.

History of Street Food and Interesting Facts

   Street Food is a type of prepared food sold on the streets and other
   public places. It is usually cheaper food than one sold in restaurants
   and it can be sold from a kiosk, portable food booth, food cart or food
   truck. Food sold there can be of local character or some, almost
   universal, type of food like hot dogs, burgers and such. Food and
   Agriculture Organization of the United Nations performed a study in
   2007 that showed that some 2.5 billion people in the world eat street
   food every day.
   [INS: :INS]

   People sold ready-to-eat food since the earliest civilizations. Ancient
   Greeks had street vendors that sold small fried fish while the Ancient
   Romans (or at least their lower classes) depended on street food for
   nutrition because they often didn’t had ovens in their homes to prepare
   food. In China (also ancient) street food was also intended for poor
   but the wealthy citizens would sometimes send their servants to buy
   them street food. Street vendors of 14th century Egypt sold lamb
   kebabs, rice and fritters. Even the Aztecs had vendors in their
   marketplaces that sold atolli (which is a gruel made from maize dough)
   and tamales with different kinds of already prepared meat. In North
   America, during the American Colonial period, street food that was sold
   was tripe, oysters, roasted corn ears, fruit and sweets. Europe of that
   time also knew about street food. Fried strips of potato were sold on
   the streets of Paris in 19th century and were the origin of french

Eat like a local: The enchating flavours of Bengali street food

   Leave a Comment / Food &amp; Culture / By chandrani

   Ever since I was a child, I used to hear about street food all the
   time. It’s like every family in India has their own little story of
   eating on the streets and how it impacted their life.

   My grandmother told me that her love for “murgir jhol” came from
   growing up in Calcutta and ate at this one stand that served delicious
   “murgir jhol”.

   Street food culture is so rich with history and memories! There are
   many varieties of Indian street foods, but Bengal cuisine stands out
   because of its unique flavours infused with mustard oil, which tastes
   kind of spicy yet mellow at the same time.

   With the long history of this region, it’s no surprise that you can
   find mouth-watering delicacies everywhere! This region also has
   influences from Bangladesh due to migration patterns over the years.

   Bengal’s culinary scene is diverse, vibrant, and ever-rewarding for any
   foodie. The dynamism of Bengal’s cuisine can be found not only in
   traditional kitchens or legendary restaurants but also in the city’s
   street food culture.

The street food culture in Bengal:

   Street food has always been popular among the masses. The types of
   street foods have also evolved over the years to match changing
   consumer preferences.

   Street food is usually an affordable way to enjoy delicious cuisines,
   especially for people who cannot afford to eat at restaurants all the
   time. Moreover, it is not difficult to find street food vendors
   anywhere globally. They are located on busy streets and markets in
   towns and cities across continents like Europe, America, Asia and
   Australia.

   Street foods are distributed by mobile vendors or peddlers that carry
   their baskets or bags when travelling from one place to another in
   search of potential customers. These peddlers often roam around markets
   at dull hours, searching for hungry people who would like to eat before
   or after their main meals.

   It is up to you whether you choose to enjoy street food by sitting at a
   local restaurant or buying types of street foods in Bengal from a
   mobile vendor.

    India’s street vendors are the essence of our country's food industry
    Thursday, 10 December, 2020, 13 : 00 PM [IST]
    Ritesh Tulsian
   Indian street food has a very special gastronomic place in India’s food
   history and culture. Indian street food is probably the first thing
   that comes to the mind of food lovers when they think or talk about
   food. Indian street foods are known worldwide for their taste,
   diversity and easy accessibility and available all across the country
   whether it’s a metropolitan city or a small town or a village.
   As there is no conclusive documented history of Indian street food so
   it’s not easy to know exactly when it began but as per the popular
   belief street food in India became popular in Delhi when the Mughal
   Emperor, Shah Jahan moved his capital from Agra to Delhi. Chaats the
   most popular variety of street food available across India today was
   first introduced in Old Delhi to the vegetarian traders as a mid day
   meal by chaat specialist cooks that were invited from Varanasi to Delhi
   to set shop by the officials of the Mughal Dynasty.
   Another variety of street food is Kebabs, Nihari, Biryani, Kormas,
   etc., also seen gaining a lot of acceptance amongst the middle income
   group of the inhabitants of old Delhi who loved their meat and relished
   gorging on these amazing delicacies served either for breakfast or
   anytime during the day.
   Halwai’s (Indian pastry chefs) from Rajasthan, UP and other Indian
   states opened their business in crowded and bustling commercial market
   places of Delhi, Kolkata and other North Indian cities and offered
   variety of vegetarian options as mini meals or snacks to busy traders
   and shoppers looking for a quick, economical and wholesome products.
   Also Indian sweets became a part an integral part of all Indian
   Festivals and are even today are equally enjoyed across cultures and
   regional cuisines.
   ‘Main toh raste se jaa raha tha, main toh bhel puri kha raha tha'.
   Almost everyone would be familiar with this very famous 90,s Bollywood
   track. Not only does it aptly depict the actual Indian street food
   scene but is also enough to make you grab a plate of bhel puri right
   away. When it comes to street food, India tops the charts. Food and
   beverages that are usually sold on streets by hawkers and vendors in
   portable stalls and carts is what is termed as street food. Move over
   aloo chaat’s and tikkis as India has got lots to offer. Be it north,
   south, east or west, every region of India has its own specialty. Made
   with a mélange of exotic spices and ingredients, Indian street food is
   one of its kinds. Apart from Indians, a lot of foreign travelers swear
   by Indian street food as well.
   Why is street food loved across the nation so much?
   Ask any food lover who loves to eat at a roadside food stall as to why
   they're so fond of street food? We bet, you won't just get a single
   reason, because there are so many reasons behind the cravings for
   street food throughout the world. To name a few:
   •    Street foods are the cheapest. For people who don't have a
   sufficient income, people who are bored of eating a home-cooked meal,
   unemployed people, Indian street food comes as a blessing for everyone.
   No matter who you are or what your financial status is, street food is
   something that fits everyone's pockets.
   •    Many times when you walk on the road, the smell of some roadside
   dish hits you, and you decide to stop and have a plate of your favorite
   food item. And even if you're full, you still choose to have it,
   because there's always a particular space reserved for such
   mouth-watering food.
   •    Ever observed the people who eat roadside food? If you did, then
   you must be aware of the way they eat - some are slurping, some are
   licking their fingers; some are just busy smelling the food before they
   finally decide to eat. This is why most people love eating at the
   roadside. It feels great to eat the way you want to, to eat like a
   hungry animal and still not get judged. Because let's be honest,
   everyone over there does the same thing.
   •    Who would doubt the authenticity of this sentence when we say that
   street foods are tasty! You won't find a single food stall across the
   world where people don't enjoy the taste of the food they're offered.
   The vast variety of Indian street food
   India is a country where you will find diversity in everything. The
   difference in culture, diversity in languages spoken, a variety of
   people, and diversity in food as well. Every Indian state, every Indian
   city has its specialty when it comes to street food.
   Can you roam the streets of Indore without having the mouth-watering
   'Poha and Jalebi' which is the finest street food and specialty of
   Indore? Can you walk through the busy and crowded lanes of Mumbai
   without grasping a 'Vada Pav'? What about the lip-smacking 'Aloo
   Tikkis' of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh or the most popular 'Idlis and
   Vada-Sambhar' of Chennai? Jhal Mudi, Kolkata Style Kathi Kebab Rolls,
   Mughlai Paratha or the Fish Fry from the streets of Kolkata will make
   you stop right what you are doing as you won't be able to resist the
   temptation! When it comes to street food, no other country can beat
   India where not just one or two or three, but every single state and
   city has its variety of delicacies.
   Talk about the famous 'Bikaneri-Kachori' of the royal state of
   Rajasthan, India. Bikaner is noted for its amazing cuisines and
   delectable street foods. Not just Bikaneri-Kachori, the desert state is
   also favourite for its famous Dal-Baati Churma and Pakoras. These food
   items can be found in almost every street stall of Bikaner.
   What makes Indian street food so popular?
   The popularity of Indian street food can be known from the very fact
   that every day millions of people from different regions prefer to eat
   roadside food from various street vendors. According to our Ancient
   Hindu Dietary rules, there are two concepts when it comes to food -
   Kaccha food and Pakka food. These concepts are still at play even
   today. Kaccha food was traditionally only consumed at home because
   Kaccha food such as rice and dal require certain kind of purifying
   rituals to deliver them safe for people to eat whereas Pakka food items
   can be securely consumed outside one's house. Hence, Indian street
   foods are generally made from the Pakka food items because that's what
   is acceptable amongst most consumers.
   If we take a look at the health and hygiene aspect of Indian street
   food today, it is no more unclean or unhealthy (unless you eat from
   some very rearward area.) You will find that almost every other Indian
   street food vendor uses vegetables, pulses as well as many ayurvedic
   spices such as garlic and turmeric. All these healthy ingredients add
   to the richness of street food. Moreover, many street vendors these
   days wear disposable gloves to avoid any health problems.
   Some people in India often try to stay away from roadside stalls
   because they're concerned about the hygiene. But if you ask me, Indian
   street foods are way much healthy, better, and freshly cooked. It
   satisfies us to see that the food that we're going to eat is cooked
   right in front of our eyes. What can be better than this? The street
   vendors of India make a living out of their stalls, so they'll always
   make sure to satisfy their customers so that the customers visit again.
   And which is why they also make sure that the food is not only tasty
   but at the same time fresh and hygienic. It is why we Indians can
   proudly say that our street foods are the best and the most popular
   ones.

   many delicious, traditional food to taste.

   Different spices and herbs can be used to add to the taste of the
   traditional recipes so Indian food can vary slightly from place to
   place. We’ve put together a list of some popular, must-try, traditional
   Indian dishes and the best places to try them while you’re exploring
   the country.

Best Traditional Indian Food To Try Before Leaving This Glorious Country

Biryani

   Biryani-Indian-Food Biryani-Indian-Food

   Biryani is a traditional dish that varies in flavor, how it’s cooked,
   and ingredient combinations depending on the region.

   Biryani is a very famous and popular Indian dish and makes for mouth
   watering meal. While the dish’s exact point of origin can’t be
   determined, there are certain places and regions in India it’s more
   associated with.

   The various types of biryani include pukki, Hyderabadi, South Indian
   and more.

   Best places to try Biryani in India

   Lalla Biryani is a restaurant located in Chaupatiyan Chowk, Lucknow.
   Biryani in Lucknow is known as “pukki biryani” where the meat and rice
   is cooked separately and then layered onto one another to create the
   dish. Lalla’s biryani is made with care and precision to ensure you’re
   getting a perfect meal.

   Hotel Shadab, in Hyderabad, is an old and popular hotel which serves
   traditional Hyderabadi biryani. This is the perfect place to go if
   you’re looking for an authentic meal to share with your family or
   friends.

   Hyderabadi biryani is made with raw meat which is marinated in spices
   for hours before it’s added to the meal. Rice is then added with spicy
   yogurt over the meat in the preheated handi (a wide cooking vessel).

   Only then is the meal slow cooked and sealed with dough.

Samosa

   Samosa-Indian-Food Samosa-Indian-Food

   Samosas are great as a snack or a starter course. A samosa is a small
   pocket of fried or baked dough which is filled different savory
   ingredients, such as potatoes, onions or peas seasoned with spices.

   While they are usually a vegetarian dish, there are variants where meat
   is included. This delicious little snack is very popular and can
   usually be found at your local grocery store.

   Best places to try Samosas in India

   Manohar Dhaba in New Delhi serves an interesting variant of the
   traditional samosa, which you should definitely try. This small food
   joint serves the Japani Samosa, which involves 60 layers of crispy
   pastry filled with spiced potato.

   Guru Kripa in Mumbai makes heaps of samosas every single day as people
   are always flocking to get some. If you’re in Mumbai you should
   definitely check out this eatery and their popular Chana Dal Samosas.

   Tewari Sweets, located in Kolkata, serves deliciously spiced samosas
   wrapped in pastry that has been fired with ghee (clarified butter).

Idli

   Idli-Indian-Food Idli-Indian-Food

   Idli are a sort of savory rice cake. The soft cake is a popular
   breakfast dish throughout the country and is a very healthy, low
   calorie meal.

   Idli are made by steaming a combination of rice and fermented black
   lentils.

   Idli can be paired with almost anything to make a meal that you will
   enjoy as they don’t have much flavor on their own. Different chutneys
   are usually paired with the dish.

   Best places to try Idli in India

   Murugan Idli Shop, in Chennai, serves amazingly soft and fully idli
   with spiced podi and four types of chutneys to taste it with.

   Ramassery Idli, in Palakkad, uses the traditional Ramassery recipe for
   making idli, which is different to the general style in the rest of the
   country.

   There are only a few places that know how to make this variation of
   idli, where each individual idli is made in its own container, which
   are then stacked together and steamed.

   meal.

   Tandoori chicken is usually bright red or orange in colour due the use
   of chili powder, cayenne pepper, paprika or turmeric. The tandoori
   chicken is also used in many curry recipes as a base.

   Best places to try Tandoori Chicken in India

   Moti Mahal, in Delhi, is well known for its delicious tandoori chicken.
   It’s the perfect place to have a nice, authentic Indian dinner with
   your family or friends.

   in a batter and then deep fried into a crispy state.

   They are usually made with potatoes, onions, spinach or paneer (a type
   of cheese). Pakoras are generally served as a snack or appetizer with
   different condiments, such as chutney or raita.

   Best places to try Pakora in India

   Khandani Pakode Wala is a fast food joint in Delhi that serves some
   truly scrumptious pakoras that you can enjoy sharing as an appetizer.

Learning The History Of Indian Food

   Home » Learning The History Of Indian Food

   India is known for having some of the best food culture in the world.
   The number and range of spices and fresh ingredients used across the
   country has led to an unparalleled diversity of flavors. Throw in the
   seemingly countless ways in which dishes are prepared and composed, and
   you have some of the tastiest dishes on Earth.

   In order to truly appreciate Indian cuisine though, it’s necessary to
   understand how much food varies between regions, and the historical
   processes that led to these differences.

   For those who are merely looking to enjoy delicious food, history might
   not seem to be of the utmost relevance, beyond the basics. When you
   really study a culture, however, you learn just how important the past
   is in defining the flavors of a country that we enjoy today. People who
   are well versed in international studies come to understand that
   history, cultural development, and even religion all play key roles in
   shaping what we see and experience in any given country in the present.
   And this kind of understanding is particularly relevant in India, where
   the differences in how regions have developed have specifically led to
   fascinating variations in culinary tendencies from one place to the
   next.

   Indian cuisine is the result of thousands of years of evolution and
   outside influences from regions like Persia and China. The country’s
   efficient trading networks have long provided access to almost any
   spice in existence, from chilis, to cinnamon, to mustards –– leading
   perhaps most importantly to the creation of different types of masala.
   This variety of spice mixes led in turn to the creation of numerous
   types of stew known as curry. At the same time meanwhile, the disdain
   for alcohol in Indian culture has led over time to the cultivation of
   different types of juices and hot drinks (like the much-celebrated
   chai), which only further enhance the country’s flavor offerings, so to
   speak.

   In these ways, different cultures, religions, and events shaped India’s
   cuisine over time. Inevitably though –– given the vastness of the
   country, the variation in trade networks and resource availability, and
   even the different major religious influences over time –– different
   regions within the country also developed unique flavors and dishes. As
   we alluded to in a prior look at northern cuisine in the country, every
   part of India has its own unique cuisine.

   For a few significant examples, consider the following….

1. Delhi

   Among other things, Delhi is known largely for its different types of
   stuffed flatbread, kababs, and Indian ice cream. All these are Delhi’s
   takes on popular meals, and are drawn from the blend of cultures that
   exist in the city. Street food is the name of the game, ultimately, and
   this also means variety. You’re likely to find foods from different
   regions in Delhi if you look and ask around.

2. Kerala

   The best local cuisine also takes advantage of special, available
   ingredients. Food in Kerala, for example, is mostly vegetarian (with a
   healthy dose of seafood), and also takes advantage of the spice that
   has long been produced in the area –– namely, ginger, cardamom, and
   black paper. There are numerous dishes specific to Kerala, but one
   worth knowing is Arikadaka, a dish made by cooking mussels with rice
   flour in their shell.

3. Punjab

   Punjab cuisine has a strong Central Asian influence (typically
   associated with India’s Muslims rather than its Hindu population). The
   meals are usually rich in butter and whole wheat. That said, this is
   also considered an area of fairly diverse cuisine, and one in which
   you’re more likely to find a sampling of Indian food from different
   regions. One of the most popular dishes though is the Sarson ka saag,
   made of mustard greens, ginger, and garlic, accompanied with makki di
   roti, a type of flatbread from the northern regions of India.

4. Sikkim

   This particular region is influenced by multiple ethnic groups at once,
   though it’s the Nepalese cuisine that largely defines the food scene.
   Meat, rice, milk, and some locally grown vegetables are staple
   ingredients, though there are also some surprising elements to the
   cuisine as compared to most of the rest of India. For instance, the
   Bhutia Buddhists in the area will consume beef (which many Indians do
   not), and alcohol is far more prevalent in Sikkim.

   It wouldn’t be possible to cover the complex history and culture of
   India and how the cuisine has come to be in a single article. To do so
   would require a study of Muslim and Hindu influence, a record of
   conquests, complex studies of trade over centuries, and consideration
   of where ingredients come from. But we hope that this piece has given
   you a sense of the complexity, and an appreciation for how learning a
   place’s history and culture can help you appreciate wonderful food even
   more.

     * Street food of Delhi

   The unique culture and cuisine of Delhi displays a generous blend of
   diverse influences. Our rich regional cuisines with time have
   interacted and influenced each other in a way, giving rise to new
   flavours and cuisines. The glorious historical past of Delhi impacted
   its food no less. The cuisines of Delhi saw Hindu-Rajput, Bania,
   Kayastha, Turkish, Arabic, Perian and Mughal influences due to the
   culturally diverse emperors that ruled Delhi over the centuries. The
   influence of Mughal food had the longest influence, so much so that
   Mughal cuisine and Indian cuisine became synonymous. Due to its vibrant
   food tradition- both non-vegetarian and vegetarian, delicacies and
   street food Delhi ranks as the gastronomical of India.
   Our team of city explorers are unsurpassed in knowledge and ensure that
   your walking tour exceeds your expectations. We at Delhi Walks would be
   delighted to be of assistance in planning and executing all
   your sightseeing requirements.

   For the best street food experience visit Old Delhi. It offers a wide
   range of variety. The famous paranthewali gali and lanes of narrow
   lanes of Old Delhi offers the best stuffed breads deep-fried in ghee,
   sweets, chaat, chole bhature, jalebi, rabdi etc. Chole bhature, jalebi
   and warm milk are preferred breakfast. The Jama Masjid area is ideal
   for mouth-watering and tasty non-vegetarian delicacies like mughlai,
   kebabs, tandoori items and Mughal sweetmeats at Ghantewala Sweet etc.
   From Aaloo-Gobi to bhindi-Karela to meva-rabdi you can find everything
   in this exotic area of Delhi. Since Delhi is a cultural hub there
   nothing that you will not find here. If you begin with Old Delhi or
   Purani Dilli you may indulge yourself in exquisite street foods with a
   variety of dishes that you can choose from. In fact there are exclusive
   lanes dedicated to food in this part of Delhi.
   The exclusive lanes dedicated to food has its own range of cuisines.
   You can Nehari at Bismillah and Afghani pulao and green tea at
   Pathanwadi. Kulle, a unique chaat made by scooping out the centre of a
   tomato, banana, cucumber or sweet potatoes and filled with chick peas,
   pomegranate, lemon juice and spices; sandwiches, samosas, tikkis,
   golgappas, papri chaat and tikkis are the all-time favourite of Old
   Delhi. The Kebabs and biryanis from Pandara road, sweetmeats and chaats
   from Bengali market are worth mentioning. Delhi has something to offer
   every food-lover. Whether you want to spend your evening dining in an
   elite boutique restaurant near Connaught Place, Chanakyapuri, Qutub
   Minar, Khan Market, GK I and II, Defence colony or Hauz Khas or a
   simple exotic meal at roadside jam packed “dhabas” Delhi is sure to
   tantalise your taste buds. Above all, Mughlai cuisine has the highest
   demand among outsiders and Delhiites. Mughlai- a cuisine borrowed from
   the Mughals who ruled Delhi in the medieval times is pretty popular in
   Delhi, North India and the world for its spicy flavor and aroma.

   For a mind-numbing food experience try the spicy treats offered at Old
   Delhi, near the Chandini Chowk metro station. Pamper your sweet tooth
   with the Rabri Faludas from Giani’s near Fatehpur Masjid in the same
   area. To experience the best of state foods visit Dilli Haat. Know more
   about your culture and cuisines at this extraordinarily colourful
   market. For Asian, Continental and European cuisines a number of
   restaurants and cafes can be tried at Connaught Place, Saket, Hauz
   Khas, Defence Colony etc. For quick bites, Subways and Mc Donald’s are
   quite popular in Delhi. Do not dread the ‘red and green chili’ used
   greatly in Indian foods for our food has attracted a number of
   Westerners. Lately, European cuisine has gained so much popularity in
   Delhi that a number of fusion restaurants have come up.

   We are expert in walking tours and we’ve earned a solid reputation for
   our passion, enthusiasm and importantly, our sense of showcasing the
   character of the city.

   Popular street foods of India, popular roadside food of India. Chaat is
   a term that is very tightly bound with Indian Cuisine. Traditionally
   street food, chaat has now found a place at famous restaurants, parties
   and weddings the world over. These savory snacks are as plenty as they
   are popular. Each part of India has its own provincial chaats, using
   local ingredients and seasonal veggies or fruits too.

   Various types of savories, chutneys, spice powders and fresh produce
   are deftly arranged on dishes in such a way that the appearance and
   aroma lure passers-by to the vendor. The chaatwala works like a
   magician, briskly mixing the perfect ingredients in the perfect
   quantities, sprinkling the right masalas, and loading just the right
   amount of the right toppings, in a suave fashion that holds your
   attention.

   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   Mumbai roadside pani puri | homemade pani puri | puchka | golgappa |
   with amazing 50 images One of the most loved, very famous and tempting
   Mumbai street food that no one can resist to eat “pani puri”. Who
   doesn’t love Mumbai roadside pani puri? From kids to elderly people
   everyone loves eating the mouthwatering puchka. Pani translates to
   water and puri are puffed crispy dough balls which are hallow. The
   puri’s are made in different shapes and sizes across India. It is
   extremely famous in cosmopolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata.
   Pani Puri, have it spicy sweet or balanced – just the way you like it!
   it is a delight to watch the vendor skilfully punch a tiny hole in each
   puri thereafter adding the fillings and dipping it in the meetha
   chutney and teekha pani. Because of the hygiene and cleanliness issue,
   many people prefer making pani puri at home from scratch. The elements
   required for making homemade golgappa are - crispy puri, a stuffing of
   your choice (soaked boondi, boiled potatoes, chickpeas and moong or
   ragda) and pani (teekha phudina pani and sweet imli pani). There are
   many other versions of pani too like lehsun ka pani, jaljeera, hing
   jeera pani.The recipe can be modified as per your preference. If you
   are making a mixed sprouts stuffing for pani puri then you would
   require some pre-preparation of 2 days. For our homemade pani puri, we
   have made everything at home from the scratch. We have started with
   making the puri first. To make super-crisp and perfect Puri for Pani
   Puri, right at home. The semolina and plain flour dough is made with
   chilled soda, which makes the small puris to puff up while frying. The
   amount of soda needed to make the dough will differ, depending on the
   quality of the semolina and flour, so be mindful when mixing. You will
   really relish the crisp texture of these puris. Once the dough is
   kneaded, divide it into equal portions, roll into a thin chapatti. Cut
   into circles using a cookie cutter and deep fry till they puff up. To
   make golgappa, we have first made the teekha phudina pani, combine mint
   leaves (phudina), chopped coriander (dhania), lemon juice, green
   chillies, ginger (adrak), 2 whole black peppercorns (kalimirch), black
   salt (sanchal) and cumin seeds (jeera) powder in a mixer jar and blend
   it into a paste. Transfer the paste to a deep bowl and add 3 cups of
   chilled water, mix well and our teekha phudina pani is ready. You can
   keep it in the refrigerator and take it out when serving. Further we
   have prepared mixed sprouts mixture for pani puri. Combine parboiled
   mixed sprouts, boondi (soaked for 10 minutes and drained), mashed
   potatoes, coriander-cumin seeds (dhania-jeera) powder, chilli powder
   and black salt (sanchal). Mix everything well. Our mixture is ready!!
   You can also use ragda as the filling. To serve this mouthwatering
   snack pani puri you need to rack a small hole in the centre of each of
   the 6 puris and stuff each puri with a little mixed sprouts mixture.
   Top it with a little meetha chutney and dip the entire puri in the
   teekha phudina pani. Serve homemade pani puri immediately. Make sure,
   you assemble Mumbai roadside pani puri only when you are eating it or
   else it will get soggy and the crispiness of the puri will be lost.
   Here’s a tip for the teekha phudina pani - if you have time in hand you
   can use room temperature water and refrigerate it for 3 to 4 hours.
   Chilling the pani for 3 to 4 hours enhances the flavours. Once you are
   done don’t forget to have a free sip of teekha pani and a sukha puri to
   bring the delightful experience to a fitting end! Also try out other
   popular Mumbai street food snacks like Kaanda Bhajji Pav, Ragda
   Pattice, Pav Bhaji and Jini Dosa. Enjoy Mumbai roadside pani puri |

   ke pakode | quick snack is a tasty snack to be enjoyed at a family
   get-together. Learn how to make cabbage pakora South Indian style. To
   make cabbage pakoda, combine all the ingredients along with approx. 2
   tbsp of water in a deep bowl and mix well. Drop spoonfuls of the
   mixture into hot oil in a deep non-stick pan and deep-fry a few at a
   time on a medium flame, till they turn golden brown in colour from all
   the sides. Drain on an absorbent paper. Serve immediately with green
   chutney and tomato ketchup. Pakodas don’t always have to be
   onion-based. Here is an irresistibly crunchy and excitingly flavoured
   cabbage pakora South Indian style made with patta gobhi. With a
   flavourful touch of coriander, the cabbage is held together with besan
   to make awesome pakodas. The Indian patta gobhi ke pakode pairs best
   with green chutney or tomato ketchup. You can also serve them hot and
   fresh for parties or as a quick snack, with a cup of steaming tea or

   pakoras like Khichdi Pakodas, Stuffed Methi Paneer Pakoda, Stuffed
   Spinach Pakoda to make a pakoda platter. Tips for cabbage pakoda. 1.
   Cabbage should be shredded thinly as shown here. 2. Remember to not add
   too much water while mixing the ingredients because cabbage will also
   slowly let out water as you have shredded it thinly. That, along with a
   tablespoon or two of water, is enough to bind the batter. If the batter
   becomes watery, the pakodas won’t be crunchy enough. 3. This mixture
   should be used immediately and not kept for long as it will release
   water and you will find it difficult to make pakodas. 4. Oil should be
   hot and always deep-fry on a medium flame so they cook well. Do not fry
   them over low flame, the cabbage pakoda will absorb too much oil and
   turn soggy. And if you deep-fry on a high flame then they will get
   burnt. Enjoy cabbage pakoda recipe | cabbage pakora South Indian style
   | Indian patta gobhi ke pakode | quick snack | with step by step

   | Indian street food chole tikki chaat | with 35 amazing images. chole
   tikki chaat also called aloo tikki chole is a popular Indian street
   food. Here, we show you how to make the potato and peas tikkis for
   Punjabi chole tikki chaat perked up with flavourful nigella seeds and
   spices, and the recipe for chole too. Also pay special attention to
   arranging this preparation, with curd, chutneys and fresh, crispy sev!
   A lip-smacking chaat that is loved all over India, and now globally
   too, the chole tikki chaat is most enjoyed at roadside stalls, but is
   definitely more satisfying when you make it at home for your family or
   for a party. Notes and tips on aloo tikki chole. 1. To make the Chole
   for the Chole Tikki Chaat, we first have to soak the kabuli chana. For
   that, wash the kabuli chana thoroughly under running water. Once
   washed, place them in a deep bowl. Cover them with enough water. We
   have taken approximately ¾ cup of chickpeas as they will double on size
   once they are soaked and cooked. Cover the bowl with a plate and keep
   aside to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. This is a very
   important step as this not only helps in cooking the chickpeas faster
   but also helps in cooking them evenly. 2. If you want the chickpeas to
   go soft, you can add a pinch of baking soda while pressure cooking so
   that the chickpeas cook properly. But remember you do not want the
   chickpeas to go mushy. 3. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally
   before opening it. If you open it in a haste, the chickpeas will not
   have cooked properly. 4. Make sure that your pan is really hot so that
   you get a nice crust on your tikkis. Learn to make chole tikki chaat

   8.  Mysore Masala Dosa ( Mumbai Roadside Recipe)
   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   Mysore masala dosa recipe | Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa |
   Mysore Dosa | with 65 amazing images. This is Mumbai’s own version of
   Mysore masala dosa. While the traditional Mysore masala dosa features
   chutney-smeared dosas with a simple potato masala rolled inside it,
   Mumbai’s street vendors offer a more exotic version, in which crispy
   dosas are smeared with a sweet, spicy and tangy Mysore chutney and
   rolled up with a unique masala of chopped and grated veggies perked up
   with our very own pav bhaji masala. This gives it an absolutely peppy
   and ‘local’ taste, as well as an interesting mouth-feel! Very
   sumptuous, this snack is nothing short of a complete meal, when served
   with hot sambhar and fresh coconut chutney . I would like to suggest 7
   tips to make the perfect Mysore masala dosa. 1. In case if you have
   purchased the dosa batter from the market and you find it thick, then
   add water as required to get a pouring consistency batter. 2. Add some
   sooji (rava) to get crispy brown dosas. 3. Ensure that the Mysore
   chutney is a little thick which will help in easy spreading on the
   dosa. We have used around 1 cup of water for blending. 4. To make the
   Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa, heat a non-stick tava. Grease
   it with ½ tsp of butter. Butter for greasing is used to season the tava
   and form a layer that helps in easy removal of the dosa after cooking.
   This initial greasing is done only once before making the dosas. 5.
   Sprinkle little water on the tava, it should sizzle immediately. If the
   water is not sprinkled, the excess fat will make the spreading of
   Mysore masala dosa very difficult. 6. Wipe the tava using a clean
   muslin cloth or folded tissue. This is to clean and make the tava ready
   for spreading the dosa batter. If there is any fat on the tava, the
   dosa will not spread evenly. 7. Spread the dosa batter in a circular
   motion using a ladle. Our website has a huge collection of over 129
   dosa recipes, glance through these different types of Dosa recipes to
   learn more dosa varieties. Enjoy how to makeMysore masala dosa recipe |

   momos is a steamed snack often served with momos chutney. Learn how to
   make Indian vegetable momos. To make veg momos, first make the dough.
   Combine the plain flour, oil and salt in a deep bowl and knead into a
   semi-soft dough using enough water. Cover the dough with a damp muslin
   cloth or lid and keep aside for 10 minutes. For the stuffing, heat the
   oil in a broad non-stick pan, add the garlic, ginger and green chillies
   and sauté on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the onions, carrot,
   capsicum and cabbage, mix well and cook on a medium flame for another 2
   to 3 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar, soy sauce,
   salt and pepper, mix well and cook on a medium flame for a few seconds.
   Add the spring onion greens. Keep aside. Then to make Indian vegetable
   momos, divide the dough into 22 equal portions. Roll a portion of the
   dough into a 75 mm. (3”) diameter thin circle using a little plain
   flour for rolling and place 1 tbsp of the prepared filling in the
   centre of the circle. Hold it on your palms, fold the two sides and
   pinch them. Fold the other open side and pinch it again so as to form a
   crescent shape. Steam 6 momos in a greased steamer for 10 to 12 or till
   they are cooked. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to steam the remaining momos.
   Serve immediately with momos chutney and mayonnaise. A snack that has
   become almost synonymous with Chinese cuisine, restaurant style momos
   are made of a plain flour cover filled with sautéed veggies. An apt
   combination of garlic, ginger, green chillies, vinegar and soy sauce
   flavours the vegetable mixture, and the outcome is simply
   tongue-tickling! Traditionally, Chinese style veg momos are steamed in
   bamboo baskets, but you can also cook them in a regular steamer or
   cooker, the way you make dhoklas or idlis. They are a popular street
   food in China and in north east India. You can innovate on this Indian
   vegetable momos by adding other veggies or bean sprouts to the filling,
   but make sure you choose colourful, juicy and crisp veggies to achieve
   the right appearance and to get the mild crunch that makes momos so
   enjoyable! Serve along with Vegetable Chow Mein and Chinese Fried Rice.
   Tips to make veg momos recipe. 1. You can use veggies of your choice
   such as grated paneer or finely chopped French beans. 2. Grease the
   steamer before steaming momos or else it will stick and tear. 3. Do not
   over steam momos otherwise the covering will become chewy. 4. Cover the
   momos with a damp muslin cloth after shaping them to avoid drying. 5.
   Make sure you remove the momos after cooked from the steamer using
   tongs to avoid them from breaking. 6. Do not use too much flour while
   rolling to avoid dry and hard momos. 7. Make sure the dough is semi
   soft as mentioned in the recipe or else the momos will break while
   shaping them. 8. The stuffing should be semi dry or dry to avoid them
   from turning soggy while shaping the momos. 9. Serve immediately or
   else it will turn chewy. Enjoy veg momos recipe | Indian vegetable

   generous dose of sauces is also added to bind the Indian style Chinese
   bhel together in a tangy way! Prepare this Chinese bhel snack just

   crunchy veggies like cabbage, carrots, capsicum and spring onions along
   with splashes of tongue-tickling schezwan sauce and tomato ketchup.

   14.  Nylon Khaman Dhokla (gujarati Recipe)
   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   nylon khamman dhokla | Gujarati nylon khamman dhokla | instant nylon
   khamman dhokla | with 18 amazing images nylon khamman dhokla is a soft
   and fluffy steamed snack from the Gujarati repertoire. This all-time
   favourite is enjoyed as a starter , as a tea-time snack, or even for
   breakfast. Basically, something you can have any time you are hungry!
   These Gujarati nylon khamman dhokla are so soft and spongy that the
   reference to nylon is really apt! What is more, this recipe is also
   very easy to implement if you follow these simple instructions properly
   and practice it a bit. The addition of fruit salt to the batter, and
   water to the tempering, are the two main factors responsible for the
   super-soft and spongy nature of this dhokla. Temper just before
   serving, for the perfect “100/100”! I would like to give you some
   tips/suggestions to make a perfect nylon khamman dhokla. 1. Add the
   lemon juice and salt to the dough. As this is a sweet and slightly sour
   dhokla, we add lemon juice. Alternately you can add citric acid (nimbu
   ka phool). The lemon juice (or citric acid) and fruit salt create a
   fizzy reaction which results in soft, spongy khaman. 2. Mix well using
   a whisk to get a smooth Nylon Khamman Dhokla batter. The batter will
   have to mixed very well as the sugar needs to dissolve properly. If you
   want you can keep the batter aside for 10-15 minutes till the sugar has
   properly dissolved. 3. Grease 175 mm. (7") diameter thali with a little
   oil. This is an important step because greasing helps the nylon khamman
   dhokla come out of the plate without breaking or sticking. 4. Just
   before steaming, add the fruit salt. This will react with the lemon
   juice to give a fluffy batter. 5. Gently mix the fruit salt in the
   batter till just mixed. Do not over mix the batter, it should be airy
   and fluffy like this! 6. Pour the tempering over the prepared dhoklas
   and spread it evenly. Make sure the dhoklas are warm when you pour the
   tempering or else they will not soak the water in. Serve nylon khamman
   dhokla with green chutney. Enjoy nylon khamman dhokla | Gujarati nylon

   baby corn, purple cabbage, bell pepper, carrot to give a nice bite to

   cheese with tofu to make it vegan. 3. You can buy readymade paneer from
   a local dairy or supermarket in fresh or frozen form. In case the

   readymade dosa batter. We will add a little salt and adjust the
   consistency by adding a little water, mix well and keep aside. If using

What Is Street Food?

   Street foods are ready-to-eat foods sold by vendors in public places.
   Not unlike food trucks, street food vendors can be found in a variety
   of locations including markets, fairs, and other special events.
   Convenient and affordable, it exists in many different forms and is
   popular in a variety of different countries and cultures.

What Is Considered Street Food?

   Though many street foods are characterized as fast food, it's important
   to note that they can be found in many different forms. Beyond the fact
   that it is sold by vendors in public places, there isn't one specific
   thing that defines street food. Rather, it can be identified based on a
   variety of different characteristics. These characteristics include:
     * Readiness: In general, street foods can be enjoyed as soon as they
       are purchased. Vendors prepare food for guests and serve it on the
       spot.
     * How it is sold: Street food is typically sold by vendors operating
       a food truck, cart, or stand.
     * Cost: Though prices can vary depending on your location, most
       street foods are relatively inexpensive.
     * Waiting time: In most cases, wait times for street food are
       significantly less than ordering from a restaurant. Many street
       foods are already prepared when they are sold, while others can
       quickly be cooked.
     __________________________________________________________________

Asian Street Food

   Though it is enjoyed everywhere, street food is particularly popular in
   South and Southeast Asian countries. City streets in countries like
   India, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan are often packed with vendors looking
   to feed hungry customers. No matter where you come from, chances are a
   street food vendor will have something that fits your appetite. Below,
   we’ll investigate popular street foods from a variety of Southeast
   Asian countries.

Indian Street Food

   ceramic plate

   As the second most populated country in the world, Indian food combines
   various diverse cultures and preferences. These different backgrounds
   and cultures can be observed through their street foods. Below, we’ll
   investigate some of the most popular types of Indian street food:
     * Dabeli: Widely considered a popular snack food in India, dabeli was
       first introduced in the 1960s. It consists of a ladi pav, or bun,
       filled with a seasoned potato filling, chutney, and various
       garnishes including pomegranate or roasted peanuts. The filling can
       be spicy, tangy, or even sweet depending on your preferences.
     * Kati roll: Sometimes spelled kathi roll, this popular street food
       originated in the 1930s and has since become enjoyed by people
       across the globe. The key components of a kati roll are kebabs and
       paratha bread. The kebab can be made from a variety of different
       meats including chicken, beef, or mutton, while paratha bread is a
       popular type of flatbread. Once it has been prepared, the dish is
       wrapped in paper and handed to the customer.
     * Misal: There are two main variants of misal are misal pav and
       puneri misal. Misal pav is known for its spicy flavor and is served
       alongside a pav, which is a type of Indian bread roll. Conversely,
       puneri misal is traditionally thought of as a breakfast food,
       though it can also be enjoyed as a snack later in the day. Misal's
       nutritional value and inexpensive cost contribute toward it's
       popularity.
     * Kachori: Kachori, sometimes spelled as kachauri or kachodi, is
       popular across India and parts of South Asia. This deep-fried
       street food can be prepared using all-purpose or whole wheat flour
       and can be found in several different variations. Some are dipped
       in syrup, others are flavored with peppers and chili powder, and
       some are even prepared with coconut.

Chinese Street Food

   food market

   China, which spans over 3.7 million miles, boasts an extensive
   selection of street food. Every morning, city streets come alive with
   commuters, pedestrians, and street food vendors. With many different
   regions and climates, their cuisine reflects a variety of distinct
   flavors and food variations. Some of the most popular Chinese street
   foods include:
     * Jianbing: Often referred to as Chinese crepes, jianbing (pronounced
       JEN-bing) is one of the most popular Chinese breakfasts. Vendors
       can be found in nearly every major city across the country. While
       many people might associate sweet flavors with crepes, jianbing
       offers a significantly different taste. The food can be prepared
       using several different topping combinations, with some of the most
       popular including eggs, scallions, ham, and onions.
     * Jiaozi: Jiaozi is a type of dumpling which is typically enjoyed in
       China and other nearby countries. Though the dish is most
       synonymous with Chinese New Year, many people continue to enjoy it
       year-round. They are often filled with some combination of ground
       meat and vegetables and are sometimes served alongside sesame oil
       dip or black vinegar.
     * Baozi: Also known as Chinese bread buns, baozi is available in two
       different variations: big buns and small buns. The big bun variety
       is typically served in street food settings, while the small bun
       variety is more common to find served in restaurants. Baozi is
       typically filled with meat or vegetables and can be enjoyed
       alongside vinegar, soy sauce, and other various dips.
     * Chuan: Sometimes spelled as Chuan’r, this popular Chinese dish is
       similar to a kebab. It consists of pieces of meat that are placed
       on a skewer and roasted over a fire, though they can also be
       deep-fried in some cases. The most popular types of meat used for
       chuan are lamb, chicken, and pork. It’s important to note that this
       dish originates from Chinese-Islamic cuisine and is particularly
       popular with the Uyghur people.

Vietnamese Street Food

   Vietnam offers a large selection of unique, flavorful, and affordable
   foods. These foods are perfectly exemplified through their street
   foods, which combine a long list of recognizable dishes with an
   assortment of under-the-radar options. Though street food can be found
   in many different places across Vietnam, it is perhaps most popular in
   open-air markets. These markets allow vendors, artisans, and more to
   sell to the community. Some of the most popular options include:
     * Pho: Considered the national dish of Vietnam, pho is a type of soup
       dish prepared with rice noodles, meat, and broth. It is typically
       prepared with beef, but can sometimes be made with chicken. There
       are two different variations of pho in Vietnam: the Hanoi
       variation, also known as the northern variation, and the Saigon
       variation, also known as the southern variation. The key
       distinction between these two variations is the size of their
       noodles and the mix of herbs used to prepare them.
     * Bun cha: Bun cha is a type of grilled Vietnamese meatball. It is
       made from pork and is often served alongside vermicelli noodles or
       rice. Other common bun cha mix-ins include pickled vegetables,
       fresh herbs, and crushed garlic or chili. The dish is also served
       with a lime dipping sauce.
     * Xoi: Able to be served at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, xoi is a
       versatile street food that can be prepared in a variety of
       different ways. The dish consists of a bowl of rice which is mixed
       with various add-ins to create a delicious snack. Some of the most
       popular variations of xoi include xoi xeo, which consists of yellow
       rice topped with fried onion and mung beans, xoi ga, which is
       topped with steamed pieces of chicken, and xoi dua, which is
       prepared with sugar and sesame seeds.
     * Cao lau: Cao lau is a type of Vietnamese noodle bowl that is most
       popular in the country’s Quang Nam province. The traditional
       ingredients required to prepare cao lau are rice noodles, meat,
       vegetables, and herbs. It’s important to note that in most cases,
       the rice has been soaked in lye water, giving it a unique texture
       and color.

Taiwanese Street Food

   Taiwanese street food is influenced by a variety of different cuisines.
   Often found in night markets, street food in Taiwan reflects Taiwanese
   culture. Night markets, which can often span over large areas, offer a
   large selection of foods for visitors to choose from and have grown to
   become one of the most popular places to visit in the country. To learn
   about some of the most popular Taiwanese street foods, continue reading
   below:
     * Gua bao: Sometimes called pork belly buns, gua bao (pronounced gwa
       bow) is popular across Asia, particularly in Singapore, Japan, and
       Taiwan. It is prepared by placing stewed meat (typically pork) on a
       steamed bun known as lotus bread. Gua bao is often prepared with
       pickled mustard greens and peanuts, though a variety of toppings
       can be added.
     * Mochi: Often thought of as a Japanese dish, mochi is also popular
       in Taiwan. The dish is made from whole rice grains or glutinous
       rice which has been beaten into a type of flexible paste. Due to
       its versatility, mochi pairs well with many different ingredients
       and is available in several different variations. For example, in
       Taiwan it is common to serve mochi topped with peanuts or sesame
       seeds, while in other areas of the world it is prepared with rice
       grains, miso, or even red beans.
     * Taro balls: Taro balls are a traditional Taiwanese dessert. As the
       name suggests, the key ingredient in taro balls is taro, a tropical
       plant that grows in Southeast Asia and the surrounding regions.
       Believed to be one of the earliest cultivated plants, taro has
       strong roots in Taiwanese culture. Taro balls are made by mixing
       water and sweet potato flower with taro, resulting in a soft and
       versatile dessert. They can be served hot or cold and are often
       accompanied with syrup or served on top of other Taiwanese
       desserts.
     * Dorayaki: Another dessert that is popular in both Japan and Taiwan,
       dorayaki is traditionally prepared by combining red bean filling
       with two sweet pancakes. As is the case with many street foods,
       there isn't one specific set of toppings or mix-ins to go along
       with dorayaki. While some prefer red beans, others choose to fill
       dorayaki with ingredients such as cream, chocolate, and sweet
       potato.

Frequently Asked Questions

   Whether you’re new to street food or are looking to improve your street
   food service, it’s important to stay educated on how to succeed. Below,
   we’ve included answers to some of the most frequently asked questions
   about street food businesses.

What Do I Need to Sell Food on the Street?

   Having the right equipment and supplies for your street food business
   can put you in a position to succeed. Consider buying the following
   items to ensure you run a convenient and functional street food
   business:
     * Food cart: Mobile food carts and kiosks make it easy to organize
       and display your foods while giving you a place to work from.
     * Serving equipment: Depending on what kinds of food you offer,
       serving utensils such as tongs, ladles, and spatulas can help serve
       food efficiently.
     * Disposables: Providing your customers with disposables like forks,
       straws, and paper plates can make it easier to enjoy food on the
       go.
     * POS equipment: Having point of sale equipment such as a card reader
       or cash drawer on hand allows you to collect payments conveniently.

How to Get a Permit to Sell Food on the Street?

   Similar to a food truck, street food vendors must obtain the proper
   permits and licenses to legally carry out their business. Before
   applying for a permit, be sure to contact your local government, as the
   necessities for acquiring a permit can vary depending on where you
   live. In most states, you are required to have a kitchen facility to
   prepare food and act as your primary address. You’ll also need to
   arrange a health inspection for the facility to verify it is up to
   local and state regulations. Once this has been completed, you can
   complete an application for a license. It’s important to note that in
   most cases you’ll need to pay an application or license fee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Street food can be found across the globe and is a significant part of
   many different cultures. Accessible and affordable, these foods allow
   us to experience traditions from other countries in ways we can’t in
   our own. Whether you’re looking to start your own street food business,
   searching for inspiration for a new menu, or just looking to learn
   about how other countries eat, educating yourself on street food can be
   highly beneficial.

   The fast food industry in India has evolved with the changing
   lifestyles of the young Indian population.^[citation needed] The
   variety of gastronomic preferences across the regions, hereditary or
   acquired, has brought about different modules across the country.

   Many of the traditional dishes have been adapted to suit the emerging
   fast food outlets. The basic adaptation is to decrease the processing
   and serving time. For example, the typical meal which called for being
   served by an ever-alert attendant is now offered as a Mini-Meal across
   the counter. In its traditional version, a plate or a banana leaf was
   first laid down on the floor or table. Several helpers then waited on
   the diner, doling out different dishes and refilling as they got over
   in the plate.

   In the fast-food version, a plate already arranged with a variety of
   cooked vegetables and curries along with a fixed quantity of rice and
   Indian flatbreads is handed out across the counter against a prepaid
   coupon. The curries and breads vary depending on the region and local
   preferences. The higher priced ones may add a sweet to the combination.
   Refills are generally not offered.

Styles[edit]

   It is common to serve different cuisines at different counters within
   the same premises. Presence of a large vegetarian population, who
   eschew non-vegetarian food, has given rise to outlets which exclusively
   serve vegetarian fast food. Also, different variety of food may be
   served depending on the times of the day. Beverages such coffee, tea,
   soft drinks and fruit juices may also be served in such outlets. Some
   outlets may additionally have specially designed counters for
   ice-cream, chaats etc.

   Popular formats of fast food business in India have the following
   features in common:
     * Wide opening on the roadside
     * Easy to maintain and durable décor
     * A cash counter where food coupons are sold
     * A food delivery counter which invariably is granite topped
     * Additional counters for Ice Creams, Chaats, Beverages etc.
     * A well fitted kitchen located so as to be visible to the customers
     * Tall tables, typically of stainless steel, where one can eat while
       standing
     * A drinking water fountain adorned with a water filter
     * Rust-proof and non-breakable crockery

   Most of the fast food outlets in India are stand alone establishment,
   few of them having more than one branch.

Darshini[edit]

   One of Bangalore's restaurateurs, Mr Prabhakar, opened an outlet called
   Upahara Darshini in mid-1980s. The novelty was that the food is cooked
   just behind the serving counter, visible to the customers, and one has
   to eat while standing by placing the food on tall tables. It is a
   self-service place where one has to buy a coupon before eating. It
   offered typical south Indian snacks at highly affordable prices
   resulting in an instant hit with the office goers as well as students.
   The size and the enclosed design of the eating space and consequent
   spilling over of the eaters onto the footpath during the busy hours
   indicates that he did not anticipate the level of success. This issue
   is addressed by those who copied the module by keeping the entire face
   of the outlet open the road. Many believe that this was a trendsetter
   and its format, described earlier, is even to this day replicated by
   other across south India. The popularity of this business module can be
   gauged from the fact that many restaurants which adopt this format have
   "Darshini" as suffix in their names.

Food courts[edit]

   Another concept of fast food that is becoming popular is that of Food
   Courts. Here also one has to purchase coupons and collect the food from
   one of the several counters. Each one of these counters serves specific
   variety of food and may be owned by different individuals or caterers.
   Food Courts are normally located on much bigger premises and may
   provide seating facility in addition to the stand and eat arrangement.
   Typically one entrepreneur owns or takes on lease the entire premises
   and promotes the place under one name. They then let out individual
   counters to different independent operators to offer different menu.
   Internal competition is avoided by not allowing more than one counter
   to offer similar food.

   Several international fast-food chains like Kentucky Fried Chicken,
   McDonald's, and Barista Coffee have their outlets in major cities. Café
   Coffee Day, again a brainchild of Bangalore-based businessman, is the
   only Indian chain which boasts of hundreds of outlets and is present
   across India. But then it is classified more as a coffee shop than a
   fast food place.

   Now local chains coupled with numerous foreign fast foods have sprung
   up in India, leading to many websites not only catering to the curated
   list of foods, restaurants and reviews but also giving option to book
   and get it delivered at your doorsteps.

Varieties of food offered[edit]

   The kind of fare they offer as of date could be just anything and
   everything. Preference of the local population and the location of the
   outlet influence the menu more than anything else. Some of the popular
   dishes offered at Indian fast food outlets are:

MBA Grad Quits Job To Become Street Food Chef, Turns Americans into Pani Puri
Fans

   By Krystelle Dsouza
   August 9, 2022
   Molly and Meherwan Irani

   MBA grad Meherwan Irani’s restaurant Chai Pani in Asheville, USA, is
   becoming the go-to for thousands of hungry Indian street food lovers
   from across borders.

   They say serendipity is often the most wonderful way of things coming
   to be. In the case of chef Meherwan Irani, the founder of ‘Chai Pani’
   in Asheville, USA, it was a vision that he had in the middle of the
   night.

   The year was 1990, and the young boy of 20, from Ahmednagar,
   Maharashtra, decided to move to the United States for his MBA degree.
   Before moving continents, however, Meherwan wanted to satisfy his
   craving for Indian street food one last time, as he knew he would
   dearly miss it when he made the transition.

   So he went all out and gorged on the papdi chaat and bhel he could
   possibly find. Street food, you see, was Meherwan’s weakness, and he
   couldn’t bear the thought of leaving it all behind. But, as this
   world-famous chef tells The Better India, life has a funny way of
   things working out.

‘I woke up in the middle of the night and had an entire plan charted out.’

   During his MBA, Meherwan met his soon-to-be wife Molly, while she was
   waiting tables at her parents’ restaurant in Myrtle Beach, South
   Carolina. It was love at first sight, and the duo soon went on to get
   married and have a child.

   In 2005, the family moved to Asheville, where Meherwan was with Lexus
   and Mercedes-Benz in management positions. Life was good and he was
   content.

   But, things were soon about to change.

   As the year 2009 dawned, it brought with it crises in the United
   States. The workforce was reeling from the catastrophic effects of the
   economic meltdown, coupled with a deep recession.

   Like every employee in the country, Meherwan was fearful. One night
   during these troubled times, he woke up with a plan.

   “I was desperate for a viable career switch. It was the middle of the
   night and I just seemed to have the vision for my future restaurant,
   Chai Pani, all planned out in my head.”

   The idea, he says, was a simple one — to introduce America to the
   Indian street food that he had grown up eating and loving. However, for
   a corporate employee to shift professions wasn’t an easy task. But he
   found support in his wife Molly.

   “Despite not having much professional culinary experience, Molly and I
   put together a profitable business plan that very night,” he recounts.
   “The next day, we took this plan to banks, private lenders, and credit
   unions.”

   But, times were tough and no one wanted to support a new venture built
   on a “high-risk and far-fetched idea”. The couple was turned down by
   everyone they approached. But if Meherwan had learnt anything, it is
   that when everything goes south, believing in the dream is what makes
   it come true.

Funding the cooking business with love

   “Molly and I wrote an open letter to family and friends and shared both
   our hearts as well as our wild idea. We knew we weren’t presenting an
   amazing investment but we really believed in our plan, and the money
   started to come — from friends, from family, from strangers,” says
   Meherwan.

   In the span of 45 days, love started pouring in and the couple managed
   to raise $75,000. In 2009, Chai Pani saw the light of day with a menu
   that had what Meherwan terms the “most democratic, egalitarian,
   approachable, affordable, and pan-Indian cuisine of India” — chaat.

   As people from in and around Asheville began frequenting the place, the
   popularity of the dishes grew. Meherwan was amazed at how loved Indian
   street food really was. So, in 2013, having tasted immense success in
   the first branch of the restaurant, he opened another branch in
   Atlanta.

   So loved was Chai Pani that it went on to win the 2022 James Beard
   Award for America’s ‘Outstanding Restaurant’.

   This, says the chef, was a memorable moment.

   He adds, “When I won the award for outstanding restaurant, it meant so
   much more than if I’d won just as a chef. This is because the award
   acknowledges everyone who works to make a restaurant exist.”

   Rightly so, for anyone who stops by Chai Pani, a fascinating sight
   beholds them. Crowds swell as people wait to get a seat at the
   restaurant, which is filled with the aromas of keema, chicken tikka,
   uttapams, and more.

   And standing proud at the door, you’ll find 52-year-old Meherwan, ready
   to welcome more guests and treat them to his specialities. “Today, in
   retrospect,” he says, “taking the leap into unfamiliar territory and
   starting my own venture is one of the best things I have ever done.”

Reminiscing India in every bite

   As part of Chai Pani’s menu, there are Indian snacks and food you’d
   typically find on the streets here, being sold at affordable prices.
   What sets them apart is that they incorporate the true taste of India,
   with their desi tadkas.

   While the sev batata dahi puri and vada pav have a fan following of
   their own, the most popular dish, as you may have guessed, is the pani
   puri. Queues wait their turn to have the golgappas drenched in the
   spicy and sweet chutneys.

   And this makes the chef’s day. “I felt Indian street food was one of
   the most underrepresented foods in Western culture. Diners craved the
   stereotype-shattering food, drinks and service of Chai Pani, and this
   crafted our success story.”

   He adds that guests have often told him how the restaurant is
   recognised as “sparking a revolution in Indian cuisine in America”. He
   now feels the circle is complete, as this is the aim he set out with.

   “I want to show our guests that Indian food is so much more diverse,
   interesting, unexpected, and personal than a handful of regional
   cuisines that have been popularised so far,” he says. “To me, there is
   no other food that captures the essence of India like street food —
   chaotic, colourful, innovative, vibrant, joyful, complex, and of
   course, delicious.”

   So while, street food lovers gorge on tangy, crunchy, spicy bhel puri
   or satisfy their sweet cravings with a dahi puri or the humble aloo
   tikki chaat, the menu also caters to non-veg aficionados. There’s keema
   pav, chicken tikka, and even some quirky dishes such as kale pakoras
   and matchstick okra fries.

   The prices of the dishes range from $9 to upto $18 and are described as
   “incredibly over the top delicious” by guests. Reviews also read that
   the food is “every minute worth the wait”. Chai Pani serves around
   1,000 customers on a busy day, and guests advise to “reach on time if
   you want to get a space to sit”.

   But curating a successful venture hasn’t been easy.

   “Opening the restaurant in a recession taught us how to make do with
   less and create a menu that was affordable and smartly developed,” says
   Meherwan, pointing to the challenges he came across while starting.
   “Our strategy helped keep our cost of goods down while also using
   high-quality ingredients.”

   What worked most for them was staying authentic, according to Chef
   Irani. “We ensured that we stayed true to the concept of Indian street
   food, which is meant to be affordable and approachable to everybody.”

   “I’m so proud that Indian food and specifically street food is being
   recognised on a national and global level.”

   Homesickness grabs you by the throat, but food-sickness sinks its claws
   into your stomach and won’t let go until you get that back-home food
   you crave: The dish your mother fed you as a kid; the after-school
   snack you looked forward to all day; the meal only your hometown can
   get right.
   Finding American food isn’t easy — tougher still because the cuisine
   defies easy definition, being inspired mostly by immigrants — but for
   any one born in the USA, they know what it is. I thought it impossible
   to find the New York Deli sandwich outside of Manhattan, or the zing of
   Cajun fish outside Louisiana. And certainly not the Jewish water bagel.
   American food is here, all over India, and not just in tourist towns or
   five star hotels. So, if you’re a homesick expat, or an Indian looking
   for that nebulous “American” cuisine, come ’n’ get it!
   The All-Day Breakfast
   A meal that will leave you loosening your belt and closing your eyes in
   a food hangover for hours afterward, but it’s well worth it.  Fluffy
   waffles, stacks of pancakes, fatty burgers, hot dogs, malts and shakes
   are ubiquitous 50s American diner food, and the All-American Diner ,
   New Delhi, has it all in true greasy form.
   The All-American Diner, Habitat World at India Habitat Centre, Lodhi
   Road, New Delhi.
   Tel: 011 43663162
   The East Coast Jewish Bagel
   The bagel with cream cheese is the staple New York American Jewish
   breakfast. The ideal bagel is topped with salt and malt and then boiled
   in water before baking it in an oven, and is puffy with a moist crust.
   At the Bagel Shop, Mumbai, their holey bread isn’t exactly the real
   deal. But I won’t kvetch too much — because although they skipped out
   on the salt and malt, they do make real ‘water’ bagels. That alone
   makes it worth the trip, even for goys.
   The Bagel Shop, Anand Villa, 13 Pali Mala Road, Bandra West, Mumbai.
   Tel: 022 26050178
   West Coast Raw Foodism
   American health gurus embraced raw foodism, and California totally
   adopted it. The promise: eating uncooked and unprocessed food promises
   a beach-ready body! (Believe it or not, it can also taste great). At
   the hippie-inspired Mocha Mojo (Chennai and Mumbai), you can eat a
   whole raw food garden lasagna before you realise they used almond paste
   instead of cheese.
   Mocha Mojo, 72, 1st Avenue, Indra Nagar, Adyar, Chennai.
   Tel: 044 42337025
   Down South BBQ
   Summer and backyard get-togethers and Independence Day celebrations
   just wouldn’t be complete without a dad in an apron messing with the
   charcoal grill, hovering over the meat. At The Barbeque, Taj Bengal,
   Kolkata , they use a gas fire, but the result is the same: Sizzling
   chargrilled chicken, pork chops and lamb.
   The Barbeque, Taj Bengal, 34B, Belvedere Road, Alipore, Kolkata.
   Tel: 033 22233939
   The New York Deli Sandwich
   A Deli sandwich says a lot about a person. What kind of bread? And
   which cold cut do you want: Turkey? Roast beef? Then choose your
   cheese; and then how many toppings; and what kind of sauce; the type of
   wet salad. The counter of the Indigo Deli , Mumbai, is so well stocked
   it’s nightmare for the indecisive. But it’s an NYC foodie’s dream.
   The Indigo Deli, 5, Pheroze Building, Chattrapati Shivaji Maharishi
   Marg, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai.
   Tel: 022 6655 1010

   The Cops-on-Breaks-Inspired Doughnut
   American movie fans know that all highway cops really do is hang out in
   coffee shops and eat doughnuts. But hey, everyone in America loves
   doughnuts, even Homer Simpson. At Mad Over Donuts ,  Mumbai, they
   clearly share the love, serving ringed donuts and filled donuts and
   iced donuts, with kitschy names like Nutty Buddy and Mamma Mia.
   Mad Over Donuts, 63, Bhulabhai Desai Marg, Breach Candy, Mumbai.
   Tel: 022 3211 0000 (Plus three other locations in Mumbai, and two in
   Delhi)
   Louisiana Cajun
   In New Orleans, Cajun is king. The seasoned, spiced, hearty meals of
   rice and game and fish go down real smooth with jazz. India’s
   well-versed on spice, so Arthur’s Theme , Pune, does a pretty good
   imitation of Down South jalapeno and cheese poppers, fish with cayenne
   pepper, fish croquettes, and chicken marinated in Cajun sauce with
   ailioli.
   Arthur’s Theme, 2,Vrindawan Apartment,Lane No 6, North Main Road,
   Koregaon Park, Pune.
   Tel: 020 26132710
   Wood-Fired Oven New York Pizza
   You can’t get a real Chicago-style pizza outside the Windy City. But
   you can get a damn good replication of its cousin, the thin-crust
   wood-fired oven pizza, at La Terrasse, Pondicherry. The simple
   semi-open-air joint has pizzas with every kind of cheese imaginable and
   toppings like pineapple that will truly melt between oven and your
   mouth.
   La Terrasse, No 5, Near Beach Corner, Subbiah Street, Puducherry Ho,
   Pondicherry.
   Tel: 413 2220809
   The California Maki Roll
   When Japanese Sushi chefs flocked to LA in the 60s to make their
   fortunes, their experiments brought the inside-out California roll into
   existence. Containing cucumber, avocado and crab meat or imitation crab
   stick, and an outer layer of rice, it’s the perfect starter for the
   uninitiated. And at Harima, Bangalore, their Japanese chef got the
   California roll just right.
   Harima, 131, Devatha Plaza, Residency Road, Bangalore.
   Tel: 080 41325757
   Tex Mex Fajitas
   In the southwest US, Spanish colonial settlers, Native Americans and
   Mexicans brought mouth-watering fajitas across the border. The dish of
   grilled meat served on a flour or corn tortilla, with added veggies,
   sour crème, and guacamole can be found in all its glory at the Rodeo
   Bar, New Delhi, along with mock saddles for seats and
   cowboy-hat-wearing waiters.
   Rodeo Bar, 12A, Connaught Place, New Delhi.
   Tel: 011 23354859
   American Vegetarian
   Vegetarians exist in the US, believe it or not. And it’s clear that
   Bean Me Up , Anjuna-Vagator, Goa, was started by an expat American. It
   gives you the whole range of substitute meats:  Tofu, seitan, and
   tempeh, the organic salads Californians love, vegan cakes and pies, and
   of course soyabean, which the place does justice to with soya whipped
   cream and even soysage! You can almost pretend you’re at Portland’s
   hippest new vegan café.
   Bean Me Up, 1639 Deulvaddo, Anjuna-Vagator, Goa.
   Tel: 0832 2273479
   Seattle Coffee and Cakes
   Seattle is known for two things: rock music and coffee. After all, it’s
   the place Starbuck’s was born. In this town, coffee is a religion. And
   just like chai goes with biscuits, American coffee must be accompanied
   by a muffin or cake. At Moonpeak Espresso, McLeodganj, Himachal
   Pradesh, you can get just that: A slice of Seattle with your Tibetan
   meditation.
   Moonpeak Espresso, Temple Road, McLeod Ganj, Himachal Pradesh.
   Fried Chicken
   Don’t go to KFC, I beg you. The breaded mixture or batter for fried
   chicken is something you have to get just right. And at Apple Bee Inn ,
   Uttarakhand, they get it. May be it’s influence of people like Tom
   Alter’s parents, American missionaries long settled in the area. Or may
   be that it’s not a fast food joint. It’s a good thing the restaurant
   doubles as a hotel; proper fried chicken has a tendency of weighing you
   down, and you’ll want to sprawl out on your bed after gorging.
   Apple Bee Inn, Village Masrana, Dhanaulty Road, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand.
   Tel: 0135 2115290
   The Health Food Craze
   After McDonald’s, health food became obese America’s new obsession. At
   Eco-nut , Kodaikanal, in this town founded by Americans, you can find
   every variation of US dieting made delicious: Granola-y cereal, dried
   fruits and seed mixes, and even home-made yoghurt. Eat up and you’ll be
   ready to master Kodi’s hills.
   Eco-nut, PT Road, Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu.
   Tel:  04542 43296
   American Style Burger
   Since the time the cheeseburger originated in Pasadena, California, a
   true American burger has evolved to include the works: Pickles,
   tomatoes, onions, lettuce, bacon, sauces, and ... that’s just the
   start. At Café 0294 , Udaipur, they’ve just got lettuce and tomato but
   the meat patty is juicy and the buns are soft.
   Café 0294, Hotel Raja Place, Burman Chambers, UIT Bridge, Saheli Marg.
   Udaipur, Rajasthan.
   Tel: 0294 25600400
   Elvis Presley’s Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich
   Elvis may not have invented the sandwich, but this was his favourite
   snack. Him, and most American kids, who wolf them down as an
   after-school snack. And at Peace, Puri, they’ve figured out the perfect
   ratio of spread to banana.
   Peace Restaurant, Chakratirtha Road, Puri, Orissa.
   Thanksgiving Dinner — Turkey, Cranberry and the Works
   Arguably the most American of meals, it has its origins with the first
   European settlers and their feasts with Native Americans.  Every
   holiday season, Le Brasserie, Le Meridien, Bangalore , serves up an
   authentic imported Butterball Turkey and cranberry sauce. If only they
   had American football on big screen TVs, and cousins, and drunk uncles,

Why Indian Cuisine Is Having a Fast-Casual Moment Right Now

   Across the country, brands are trying everything from tikka masala

Moment Right Now

   For decades, classic Indian buffets have dotted the American landscape,
   making items like chicken tikka masala, samosas, and naan recognizable
   in households across the country. But “frankly, what people know of
   Indian food is: It’s greasy, it’s creamy, it makes me sick,” said Aarti
   Sequeira, cookbook author and host of Food Network’s Aarti Party. “That
   is the biggest lie about what Indian food really is.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Indian food in the United States has long been dominated by the first
   generation of South Asian immigrants opening what New York University
   food studies associate professor Krishnendu Ray calls "curry houses" —
   the common cheap buffets where the food often becomes formulaic, with
   few kinds of sauces and strong one-dimensional flavors. Think saag
   paneer, naan, and pictures of the Taj Mahal plastered everywhere. Out
   of the approximately 350 Indian restaurants in New York City, for
   example, Ray estimates that 320 are the typical curry house format,
   while 10 to 15 are on the other extreme: upscale, expensive Indian
   restaurants like Tamarind and the Michelin-starred Junoon.
   " "At its very core, we wanted to just change the way people thought
   about Indian food in America.""

   But currently, the fast-casual space is booming. There's Chipotle and
   Qdoba for Tex-Mex, Shake Shack for burgers and fries, and Sweetgreen
   and Tender Greens for fancy salads. And now, a new crop of Indian
   fast-casual restaurants is growing.

   These Indian-inspired fast-casual spots are open coast to coast: from
   Saffron in Los Angeles to Indikitch and the Kati Roll Company in New
   York to Taja Indian in Denver and Houston. They're presenting
   themselves in a way that goes against Indian-restaurant stereotypes:
   with bright spaces, modern branding, and menus with dishes meant to be
   broadly appealing to the American fast-food customer. With menu items
   like the yogi salad at San Francisco's Kasa Indian Eatery and the dosa
   waffle at New York's Inday, these restaurants trying to shake up Indian
   cuisine in America. So is America now primed, finally, for the Indian
   fast-casual explosion?

   Attempting to make certain flavors more commonplace in the fast-casual
   space is not new. ShopHouse Kitchen, a growing chain that is literally
   the Chipotle of Southeast Asian food, debuted in 2011, and has learned
   some lessons while scaling. ShopHouse uses the same build-it-yourself
   concept as its Tex-Mex sister: The restaurant offers rice, noodle, or
   salad bowls (it's now also testing roti options in select locations)
   with layers of protein, vegetable, sauce, and topping options.
   ShopHouse Kitchen has since expanded to 14 additional locations across
   the DC/Maryland, Los Angeles, and Chicago markets.

   With a lot of Thai influences, the ShopHouse menu includes flavors like
   lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and Thai basil. According to
   co-founder and brand director Tim Wildin, bridging the gap between
   consumers and new-to-them ingredients happens by communicating "the top
   notes of flavors in various things that might be foreign to people,"
   referring to communication in branding, marketing, and wording on
   menus. Spice levels must also be clearly conveyed, Wildin explained,
   because that can be a barrier to entry for some people.

   ""Everyone knows what a burrito is, but not everyone knows what a kati
   roll or a thali is.""

   To lower those barriers, Indian fast-casual startups are borrowing from
   American fast-food influences. Back in 2009, the Curry Up Now chainlet
   started as a single food truck in Northern California, serving items
   like the tikka masala burrito. "It's not fusion — we hate that word,"
   said co-founder Akash Kapoor, who is positioning Curry Up Now as a
   "fine casual" concept. The company has since grown to five trucks and
   four physical restaurants around the San Francisco Bay Area.

   About half of Curry Up Now's menu offers Indian twists on burritos,
   fries, quesadillas, and tacos, while the other half tries to stay more
   traditional with Indian street food and classic dishes. "The burrito is
   100 percent Indian, but by calling it a burrito and offering it as a
   burrito, we've made the food accessible to all," Kapoor said. "Everyone
   knows what a burrito is, but not everyone knows what a kati roll or a
   thali is."

   Los Angeles gastropub Badmaash takes a similar approach with items like
   chicken tikka poutine and a spiced lamb burger. "When it really comes
   down to it, people just want to eat good food," said Badmaash
   co-founder Nakul Mahendro, talking about how to make flavors more
   approachable to a wider audience. "I think a poutine and a burger would
   scare away no one."

   Though it's not fast-casual, Badmaash — named after a term meaning
   "badass" in South Asia — is similarly branding itself as going against
   the grain, marketing social media hashtags like
   #WeAreNotAnIndianRestaurant and #FuckYourFavoriteIndianRestaurant.
   "Indian food is stuck in the ‘80s, the way Chinese food was in the
   ‘90s," Mahendro said. "At its very core, we wanted to just change the
   way people thought about Indian food in America. That's a really big
   uphill battle."

   At Curry Up Now, Kapoor is also experimenting with items like "tikka
   tikka hummus" and "Tau, the Dude," a giant samosa filled with biryani
   and an egg. Curry Up Now is even expanding its menu to offer craft
   cocktails: Its Mortar and Pestle bar shakes up a typical old fashioned
   with garam masala syrup.
   ""The idea was to take the food that I grew up with and do a simplified
   version of that in an affordable, fast, colorful setting.""

   Once a fast-casual concept clicks, there are challenges when it comes
   to super-sizing it to Chipotle-like proportions. California-based Tava
   Indian Kitchen started in Palo Alto and San Francisco with a
   familiar-sounding concept: build your own "burrotis" and bowls with
   Indian ingredients. But after Tava hired a new executive from
   Smashburger and raised $4.5 million in equity financing to scale, the
   company worked with a restaurant design firm, an ad agency group, and
   culinary talent to shift its look and feel, as well as update its food
   items. Now known as Tava Kitchen, it literally took the "Indian" out of
   its name to broaden its appeal.

   "We really have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the right
   product offering is, what the right brand positioning is, and how to
   put together a restaurant concept that's really exciting and motivating
   for customers out there," Tava Kitchen CEO Jeremy Morgan, formerly of
   Smashburger, said.

   Tava now intentionally brands itself as "South Asian" food — expanding
   its menu beyond Indian influences. It's incorporated beef and shrimp
   into main dishes, and now offers sides like South Asian mac and cheese
   (with Indian spices in the panko crumbs) and a crunchy kale and quinoa
   salad that has a masala vinaigrette. In addition to a third location in
   Alameda, California, Tava plans to expand out of state into the Denver
   area soon, and is also looking at franchising options.

   While Morgan says Tava's rebranding didn't want to deter Indian food
   loyalists, it aimed to open doors to customers who may have been
   intimidated by South Asian food in the past. But any intimidation is
   "less about the food itself," Morgan said, "it's more about perception
   than it is reality, when it comes down to it."

   The fear factor is all too real with Indian food. "The word 'curry' is
   still a difficult word for people because they automatically associate
   that with heat [spice]," Food Network's Sequeira said. Commonly
   misunderstood in the western world, curry is just a generic term for a
   style of dish — like the term "pasta" might be used in multiple
   contexts. And typical Indian food eaten at home usually departs from
   what's familiar on curry house steam tables — it likely doesn't even
   have curry powder and incorporates very little naan, said Anupy Singla,
   a cookbook author and co-founder of Chicago-based Indian food company
   Indian As Apple Pie.

   Some fast-casual entrepreneurs, like Singla, are blending their
   American perspective with the Indian dishes they grew up eating at
   home. In Colorado, Biju Thomas — whose restaurant Biju's Little Curry
   Shop opened in Denver a year and a half ago — offers South Indian-based
   food. "The idea was to take the food that I grew up with and do a
   simplified version of that in an affordable, clean, really friendly,
   fast, colorful setting," Thomas said.

   Thomas's dishes feature ingredients reminiscent of the Kerala region in
   South India: fresh coconut, ginger, garlic, and curry leaves. Bowls
   might include a base of basmati rice with spiced lentils, topped with
   sautéed vegetables and meats, all customized to the diner's liking,
   just like the bowls at Chipotle. Sometimes people come into his
   restaurants surprised that this is "real" Indian food, Thomas said —
   especially with beef on the menu.

   Thomas's plan to bring South Indian flavors to the masses is getting
   attention. Whole Foods gave Thomas the go-ahead to open a chef-driven
   concept with his regional style of Indian cuisine inside one of its
   Boulder stores — something Whole Foods now wants to expand nationally.
   In addition to two Denver locations, Thomas is also looking to expand
   Biju's Little Curry Shop locations in Colorado, California, Washington
   state, and Texas.

   In recent years, NYU Indian food scholar Ray says he has been
   approached by at least a dozen "very bullish" food entrepreneurs about
   discussing their Indian fast-casual concepts. They're likely inspired
   by those already forging ahead in the space.

   These days, Curry Up Now has a central commercial kitchen to make most
   of its sauces and chutneys for its various locations, but co-founder
   Kapoor says no preservatives or additives are added to these big
   batches, made several times a week. With food prep scaled up to his
   liking, Kapoor is looking at national expansion, either through
   licensing, franchising, or corporate stores. The goal? About 300 to 500
   physical locations around the country, with a couple food trucks in
   each major city, too.
   " "I’m excited for us to move to the next level, where we’re really
   being creative with what we’re feeding people.""

   Biju's Little Curry Shop has a central kitchen to prepare chutneys and
   to cook vindaloo, coconut coriander, and red onion masala curry bases
   each morning. Thomas's recipes are kept simple for restaurant cooks: At
   each location, meats are cooked and then blended in with each of those
   bases, and finishing items like chiles, chopped herbs, and some spices
   are added. "I needed to be able to do something that we could open
   anywhere in the country and get reasonably qualified staff and train
   them well," Thomas said.

   While many fast-casual entrepreneurs have their operations set, Ray
   advises operators that Indian flavors alone aren't going to win over
   Americans' hearts. To fight in the competitive fast-casual marketplace,
   he believes these emerging Indian chains need to make a name for
   themselves with their quality and sustainability. That means a genuine
   focus on things like food waste, organic and local vegetables, non-GMO
   ingredients, and transparency about where all their meat comes from.
   "It has to be front-loaded. It has to be aggressive. It has to be
   uncompromising," Ray said. "And they have to convey that [to
   customers]."

   Luckily, experts like Food Network's Sequeira believe that Indian food
   is lends itself to these trends: The fact that it's vegetable-forward,
   healthy, and customizable in a fast-casual space. "I think if we can
   push that aspect of Indian food, then people can get into it," Sequeira
   said.

   But moving forward, Indian fast-casual needs more culinary innovation,
   said Sequeira, who notes she's ready to see more chefs trailblazing
   beyond just wrapping up Indian food in a burrito. "I'm excited for us
   to move to the next level," she said, "where we're really experimenting
   and being creative with what we're feeding people."

   Examples of fast food (left to right, top to bottom): Cheeseburger,
   soft drink, french fries, pizza margherita, hot dog, fried chicken,
   submarine sandwich, and donuts.

   Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial
   resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a
   commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with
   frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for
   take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to
   accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
   workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570
   billion globally.^[1]

   The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which
   reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
   primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
   pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef
   patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and
   cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".

   Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the
   drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no
   shelter or seating,^[2] or fast food restaurants (also known as quick
   service restaurants).^[3] Franchise operations that are part of
   restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each
   restaurant from central locations.^[4]

   Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and
   calories.^[5] Fast food has been linked to increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol,
   insulin resistance conditions and depression.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding
   lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast food
   consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.^[11]

History

   Pulling wheat dough into thin strands to form lamian
   See also: Fast food restaurant § History

   The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with
   urban developments. Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate
   space or proper food preparation accoutrements. Additionally, procuring
   cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in
   vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive. Homeowners
   feared that a rogue cooking fire "might easily conflagrate an entire
   neighborhood".^[12] Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase
   pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever
   possible. This also ensured that customers with strictly limited time
   (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family,
   for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not
   inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as
   is expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant). In Ancient Rome,
   cities had street stands – a large counter with a receptacle in the
   middle from which food or drink would have been served.^[13] It was
   during post-WWII American economic boom that Americans began to spend
   more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism
   bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with
   the strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the
   household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had
   previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence, and
   then a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service
   and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family
   dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway
   fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is
   getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47
   minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes
   per day in 2013.^[14]

Pre-industrial Old World

   In the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population living
   in insulae, multi-story apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for
   much of their meal; the Forum itself served as a marketplace where
   Romans could purchase baked goods and cured meats.^[15] In the
   mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack and cooked
   vegetables and stews later in popina, a simple type of eating
   establishment.^[16] In Asia, 12th century Chinese ate fried dough,
   soups and stuffed buns, all of which still exist as contemporary snack
   food.^[17] Their Baghdadi contemporaries supplemented home-cooked meals
   with processed legumes, purchased starches, and even ready-to-eat
   meats.^[18] During the Middle Ages, large towns and major urban areas
   such as London and Paris supported numerous vendors that sold dishes
   such as pies, pasties, flans, waffles, wafers, pancakes and cooked
   meats. As in Roman cities during antiquity, many of these
   establishments catered to those who did not have means to cook their
   own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers,
   many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus
   relied on fast food. Travelers such as pilgrims en route to a holy
   site, were among the customers.^[19]

   Blue plaque in Oldham, England commemorating the 1860s origins of fish
   and chips and the fast food industry

   In areas with access to coastal or tidal waters, 'fast food' frequently
   included local shellfish or seafood, such as oysters or, as in London,
   eels. Often this seafood was cooked directly on the quay or close
   by.^[20] The development of trawler fishing in the mid-nineteenth
   century led to the development of a British favourite, fish and chips,
   and the first shop in 1860.^[21]

   A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the
   fish and chip shop and fast food industries.^[21] As a cheap fast food
   served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the
   Victorian working classes.^[21] By 1910, there were more than 25,000
   fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more
   than 35,000 shops.^[22] Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain
   opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in
   1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish
   and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.^[23]

   British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the
   regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective
   area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of
   fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl
   commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used
   more frequently in fast food.^[24] The UK has adopted fast food from
   other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More
   recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also
   emerged.

   As automobiles became popular and more affordable following World War
   I, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The American company White
   Castle, founded by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in Wichita, Kansas
   in 1921, is generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet
   and first hamburger chain, selling hamburgers for five cents each.^[25]
   Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita
   in 1916, introducing the limited menu, high-volume, low-cost,
   high-speed hamburger restaurant.^[26] Among its innovations, the
   company allowed customers to see the food being prepared. White Castle
   was successful from its inception and spawned numerous competitors.

   Franchising was introduced in 1921 by A&amp;W Root Beer, which franchised
   its distinctive syrup. Howard Johnson's first franchised the restaurant
   concept in the mid-1930s, formally standardizing menus, signage and
   advertising.^[26]

   Curb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in the
   1940s when carhops strapped on roller skates.^[27]

   The United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and
   American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries.
   Approximately 5.4 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of
   food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the US as
   of 2018.^[28] Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses
   have inspired many local government officials in the United States to
   propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are
   unwilling to change their fast food consumption even in the face of
   rising costs and unemployment characterized by the great recession,
   suggesting an inelastic demand.^[29] However, some areas are more
   affected than others. In Los Angeles County, for example, about 45% of
   the restaurants in South Central Los Angeles are fast-food chains or
   restaurants with minimal seating. By comparison, only 16% of those on
   the Westside are such restaurants.^[30]

Working conditions

   The National Employment Law Project wrote in 2013, "according to a
   study by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley, more
   than half (52 percent) of front-line fast-food workers must rely on at
   least one public assistance program to support their families. As a
   result, the fast-food-industry business model of low wages,
   non-existent benefits, and limited work hours costs taxpayers an
   average of nearly $7 billion every year". They claim this funding
   allows these workers to "afford health care, food, and other basic
   necessities".^[31]^[32]

On the go

   See also: Convenience food

   McDonald's first two-lane drive-thru was at the Rock N Roll McDonald's
   in Chicago.

   Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers that promise
   quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a "drive-through"
   service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles.
   Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat
   on-site. The boom in IT services has allowed customers to order food
   from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

   Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on
   the go," often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a
   finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and
   chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries,
   onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream,
   though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like chili,
   mashed potatoes, and salads.

  Filling stations

   Convenience stores located within many petrol/gas stations sell
   pre-packaged sandwiches, doughnuts, and hot food. Many gas stations in
   the United States and Europe also sell frozen foods, and have microwave
   ovens on the premises in which to prepare them. Petrol Stations in
   Australia sell foods such as hot pies, sandwiches, and chocolate bars,
   which are easy for a customer to access while on their journey. Petrol
   stations are a place that are often open long hours and are open before
   and after shop trading hours, therefore, it makes it easy to access for
   consumers.

  Street vendors and concessions

   Main article: Street food

   Street vendor serving fast food in Nepal

   Fastfood restaurant in Eastern Europe: The Pajdaš (in Prekmurje dialect
   Buddy), Murska Sobota Slovenia.

   Traditional street food is available around the world, usually through
   small and independent vendors operating from a cart, table, portable
   grill or motor vehicle. Common examples include Vietnamese rice soup
   vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands, New York City hot dog carts,
   and taco trucks. Turo-Turo vendors (Tagalog for point point) are a
   feature of Philippine life. Commonly, street vendors provide a colorful
   and varying range of options designed to captivate passers-by and
   attract as much attention as possible quickly.

   Multiple street vendors may specialize in specific types of food;
   typically, they are characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic
   tradition depending on the locale. In some cultures, it is typical for
   street vendors to call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play
   music, or engage in other forms of "street theatrics" to engage
   prospective customers. In some cases, this can garner more attention
   than the food.^[citation needed]

Cuisine

   Fastfood in Ilorin, Kwara

   Modern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared in
   an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients
   and standardized cooking and production methods.^[33] It is usually
   rapidly served in cartons or bags or in plastic wrapping, in a fashion
   that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are
   generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply
   facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are
   reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying) or assembled in
   a short amount of time. This process ensures a consistent level of
   product quality. It is key to being able to deliver the order quickly
   to the customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the
   individual stores.

   Because of commercial emphasis on quickness, uniformity and low cost,
   fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to
   achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve freshness.

  Variants

   Many types of sushi ready to eat

   Chinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular in
   Western countries such as the US and UK. They normally offer a wide
   variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has normally been
   fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice, or meat. In some
   cases, the food is presented as a smörgåsbord, sometimes self service.
   The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and
   then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to
   combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by
   weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may
   offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount.

   Lamb shish kebab

   Sushi has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world.
   A form of fast food created in Japan (where bentō is the Japanese
   variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with
   a sweet rice vinegar and served with some topping (often fish), or, as
   in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in nori (dried laver) with
   filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or cucumber.

   Pizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with
   nationwide chains including Papa John's, Domino's Pizza, Sbarro and
   Pizza Hut. It trails only the burger industry in supplying children's
   fast food calories.^[34] Menus are more limited and standardized than
   in traditional pizzerias, and pizza delivery is offered.

   Kebab houses are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East,
   especially Turkey and Lebanon. Meat is shaven from a rotisserie, and is
   served on a warmed flatbread with salad and a choice of sauce and
   dressing. These doner kebabs or shawarmas are distinct from shish
   kebabs served on sticks. Kebab shops are also found throughout the
   world, especially Europe, New Zealand and Australia but they generally
   are less common in the US.

   Fish and chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United
   Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Fish is battered and then deep
   fried, and served with deep-fried potato strips.^[35]

   A box of five chicken wings, served at a Hesburger fast food restaurant
   in Helsinki, Finland

   The Dutch have their own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal
   often consists of a portion of french fries (called friet or patat)
   with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany
   french fries is fritessaus. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat
   mayonnaise substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call
   "mayonnaise". When ordering it is very often abbreviated to met
   (literally "with"). Other popular sauces are ketchup or spiced ketchup
   ("curry"), Indonesian style peanut sauce ("satésaus" or "pindasaus") or
   piccalilli. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces,
   most famously speciaal (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and
   chopped onions; and oorlog (literally "war"): mayonnaise and peanut
   sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat
   product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a
   deep fried skinless minced meat sausage), and the kroket (deep fried
   meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs).

   Fast-food place in Portugal

   A small restaurant with pasztecik szczeciński in Szczecin, Poland

   In Portugal, there are some varieties of local fast-food and
   restaurants specialized in this type of local cuisine. Some of the most
   popular foods include frango assado (Piri-piri grilled chicken
   previously marinated), francesinha, francesinha poveira, espetada
   (turkey or pork meat on two sticks) and bifanas (pork cutlets in a
   specific sauce served as a sandwich). This type of food is also often
   served with french fries (called batatas fritas), some international
   chains started appearing specialized in some of the typical Portuguese
   fast food such as Nando's.

   An example of a local form of fast food in Poland is pasztecik
   szczeciński, a deep-fried yeast dough stuffed with meat or vegetarian
   filling, typical fast food dish of the city of Szczecin well known in
   many other cities in the country. A dish is on Polish List of
   traditional products. The first bar serving pasztecik szczeciński, Bar
   "Pasztecik" founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46
   in Szczecin.

   A fixture of East Asian cities is the noodle shop. Flatbread and
   falafel are today ubiquitous in the Middle East. Popular Indian fast
   food dishes include vada pav, panipuri and dahi vada. In the
   French-speaking nations of West Africa, roadside stands in and around
   the larger cities continue to sell—as they have done for generations—a
   range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled meat sticks known locally as
   brochettes (not to be confused with the bread snack of the same name
   found in Europe)

Business

   In the United States, consumers spent $160 billion on fast food in 2012
   (up from $6 billion in 1970).^[36]^[37] In 2013, the US restaurant
   industry had total projected sales of $660.5 billion.^[38] Fast food
   has been losing market share to fast casual dining restaurants, which
   offer more robust and expensive cuisines.^[39] Due to this competition,
   fast food giants have seen dramatic drops in their sales.^[40] While
   overall fast food sales have fallen, the number of Americans who eat in
   these restaurants "once a month or 'a few times a year'" has
   risen.^[40]

   In contrast to the rest of the world, American citizens spend a much
   smaller amount of their income on food — largely due to various
   government subsidies that make fast food cheap and easily
   accessible.^[41] Calorie for calorie, foods sold in fast food
   restaurants, costs less and is more energy-dense, and is made mostly of
   products that the government subsidizes heavily: corn, soy, and
   beef.^[42]

   The Australian fast food market is valued at more than 2.7 billion GPB
   and is composed of 1.4 billion fast food meals. This includes meals
   serviced at 17,000 fast food outlets. The fast food market has
   experienced an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent, which is the
   most rapidly growing sector of the retail food market.^[43]

   In 2012, fast food restaurants spent roughly US$4.6 billion on
   advertising campaigns, which represented an 8% increase from 2009. In
   the same period of time, McDonald's spent nearly three times as much on
   advertising as all water, milk, and produce advertisers spent
   combined.^[44]

   A study done by researchers from the Geisel School of Medicine at
   Dartmouth College saw results that suggest that when children watch
   more commercial television (and see more advertisements on fast food),
   they are more inclined to ask to visit these subsequent fast food
   restaurants.^[45] Specifically, fast food restaurants have been
   increasing their advertising efforts that target Black and Hispanic
   youth.^[46] A 2021 report from the Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp;
   Obesity indicated that fast-food restaurants spent about $318 million
   on Spanish-language TV channels. The same report found that fast-food
   restaurants spent about $99 million on majority Black viewer TV
   channels. Black youth groups viewed fast-food advertisements about more
   than white youth groups.^[47]

   The Council of Better Business Bureaus started the Children's Food and
   Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2006 which asked fast food companies
   to pledge to "advertise only more healthful products to children" with
   McDonald's and Burger King signing on.^[45] However, despite a slight
   increase in healthful food advertising, the effectiveness of this
   initiative has been disputed by studies that reveal that "children
   couldn't remember or identify healthful foods in the ads, and that 81
   percent of the 99 3 to 7 year olds in that study recalled French fries"
   even though there were no french fries in the advertisement.^[48]

Employment

   reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2022)

   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 4.1 million
   U.S. workers are employed in food preparation and serving (including
   fast food) as of 2010.^[28] The BLS's projected job outlook expects
   average growth and excellent opportunity as a result of high turnover.
   However, in April 2011, McDonald's hired approximately 62,000 new
   workers and received a million applications for those positions—an
   acceptance rate of 6.2%.^[49] The median age of workers in the industry
   in 2013 was 28.^[50] Obtaining Human Resource Management diploma or
   diploma in Fast Food Management can help to get a job in major fast
   food restaurants since it is one of the most desired.^[51]

Globalization

   McDonald's in Russia

   McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut fast food restaurants
   in the United Arab Emirates

   In 2006, the global fast-food market grew by 4.8% and reached a value
   of £102.4 billion and a volume of 80.3 billion transactions.^[52]
   McDonald's alone, has outlets in 126 countries on 6 continents and
   operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide.^[53]

   One example of McDonald's expansion on a global scale was its
   introduction to the Russian market. In order for the American business
   to succeed it would have to be accepted and integrated into the daily
   lives of natives in Moscow. Thus, the restaurant was strategically
   implemented so that its offerings would align with the distinct and
   established eating habits, also known as the customs around food,
   eating and cooking, of Muscovites. One significant characteristic of
   Russian food culture is the emphasis on knowing about the locality of
   goods that are consumed. Essentially, in order to successfully launch
   this American brand in a foreign country, McDonald's interpreted the
   local interests of consumers in Moscow by promoting the origins of the
   produce used in the restaurant.^[54] On January 31, 1990, McDonald's
   opened a restaurant in Moscow and broke opening-day records for
   customers served. The Moscow restaurant is the busiest in the world.

   The largest McDonald's in the world, with 25,000 feet of play tubes, an
   arcade and play center, is located in Orlando, Florida, United
   States^[55]^[clarification needed]

   There are numerous other fast food restaurants located all over the
   world. Burger King has more than 11,100 restaurants in more than 65
   countries.^[56] KFC is located in 25 countries.^[57] Subway is one of
   the fastest growing franchises in the world with approximately 39,129
   restaurants in 90 countries as of May 2009,^[58] the first non-US
   location opening in December 1984 in Bahrain.^[59] Wienerwald has
   spread from Germany into Asia^[60] and Africa.^[61] Pizza Hut is
   located in 97 countries, with 100 locations in China.^[62] Taco Bell
   has 278 restaurants located in 14 countries besides the United
   States.^[63]

Criticism

   Main article: Criticism of fast food

   Further information: Fast food worker strikes

   Fast-food chains have come under criticism over concerns ranging from
   claimed negative health effects, alleged animal cruelty, cases of
   worker exploitation, and claims of cultural degradation via shifts in
   people's eating patterns away from traditional
   foods.^[64]^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]^[71]^[72]^[73]^[74]^[75]^[76]
   ^[77]

   The intake of fast food is increasing worldwide. A study done in the
   city of Jeddah has shown that current fast-food habits are related to
   the increase of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Saudi
   Arabia.^[78] In 2014, the World Health Organization published a study
   which claims that deregulated food markets are largely to blame for the
   obesity crisis, and suggested tighter regulations to reverse the
   trend.^[79] In the United States, local governments are restricting
   fast food chains by limiting the number of restaurants found in certain
   geographical areas.^[80]

   To combat criticism, fast-food restaurants are starting to offer more
   health-friendly menu items.^[81] In addition to health critics, there
   are suggestions for the fast-food industry to become more eco-friendly.
   The chains have responded by "reducing packaging waste".^[81]

   Although trying to overcome criticism through healthy options on fast
   food menus, Marion Nestle, who serves as the chair of New York
   University's Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, suggests that
   fast-food industries intentionally market unhealthy foods to children
   through advertising options and therefore create customers for
   life.^[82]

   Despite so much popularity, fast foods and fast-food chains have
   adverse impacts not only on the job and social skills, but on the
   health and academic performance of students. Fifty-six percent of
   students consume fast food on a weekly basis.^[83] The researcher who
   wrote Fast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser, highlights this fact, arguing
   that this is not only a financial but also a psychological bait, in
   that the students are lured towards this early employment opportunity
   knowing little that the time spent on this no-skill-learning job is
   wasted.^[84] Two other researchers, Charles Hirschman and Irina
   Voloshin, highlight their dangerous impacts and consequences regarding
   the hiring and firing of teenage school-goers in the fast-food
   industry.^[85] Kelly Brownwell of The Atlantic Times has further
   supported this argument that Burger King and McDonald's adopted another
   dangerous practice for marketing to innocent children.^[86]

   In a research study conducted by Professors Purtell Kelly and Gershoff,
   they found that the students of fifth grades, who ate fast foods as
   compared to the students of the same age after some other social
   factors were controlled.^[clarification needed] Also, the percentage of
   the students having consumed fast food and showed poor grades was
   around 11 percent more than those who used organic foods. They are of
   the view that other social factors such as television watching, video
   games and playing were controlled to assess the real impacts of fast
   foods.^[87]

   There have been books and films, such as the 2004 film Super Size Me,
   designed to highlight the potential negative health effects from the
   overconsumption of fast food such as its contribution to obesity.^[88]

Why is it taking so long to label fast food?

What are the regulations on salt and trans-fat in junk food, and why is the
FSSAI draft still not law?

   The story so far: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) unveiled
   a new study this week which showed that salt and fat in an array of
   “junk food” was well above proposed regulatory thresholds. The packaged
   and fast foods analysed were chips, savouries, pizzas and burgers that
   are widely available in restaurants and other commercial outlets. This
   is not the first time that the CSE has conducted such research.
   However, the findings are significant as the Food Safety and Standards
   Authority of India (FSSAI) is yet to make into law draft regulations on
   setting limits, and publicising information, about nutrients in fast
   and packaged foods.

How did the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) conduct the study?

   Its Environment Monitoring Laboratory tested salts, fat, trans-fat and
   carbohydrates in 33 foods using 14 samples of chips, savouries, instant
   noodles and instant soup. There were also 19 samples of burger, fries,
   fried chicken, pizza, sandwiches and wraps, sourced from grocery stores
   and fast food outlets in New Delhi. The pizza, burgers, chips and
   snacks to be tested were stored in laboratory conditions and ground to
   a powder or paste. Then they were chemically analysed to determine the
   salt, fat, trans-fat and carbohydrate levels. The aim was to find out
   the levels of these products in actual servings/packets of the foods.

How was it established that these nutrients were above thresholds?

   To calculate this, the organisation relied on the concept of the
   recommended dietary allowance (RDA), a daily ceiling on the amount of
   salt, fat, carbohydrate and trans-fat. The RDA is based on scientific
   consensus and has been agreed upon by expert bodies such as the World
   Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Nutrition
   (NIN), Hyderabad (in India). It says that, ideally, an adult should
   consume no more than 5g of salt, 60g of fat, 300g carbohydrate and 2.2
   g of transfat every day. Further, the RDA from breakfast, lunch and
   dinner should not be more than 25% and that from snacks (assumed to be
   those munched between meals), must be no more than 10%. Thus, a snack
   should ideally have no more than 0.5g of salt and 6g of fat.

What is the law on disclosing nutritional components?

   Current Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling)
   Regulations, 2011 only require companies to disclose energy (kilo
   calories), protein, carbohydrates, total fat, trans-fat and saturated
   fat contained per 100g or per millilitre or per serve. It is not
   intuitively easy, without some mental math, to figure out how much is
   actually contained in your serving. There are also no disclosures on
   high salt content and added sugar, and no compulsion on companies to
   disclose nutritional information on the front of the pack. In 2013, the
   FSSAI, the apex food regulator under the Union Health Ministry, set up
   a committee to regulate packaged snacks. This committee, which
   consisted of doctors, nutrition experts, public policy activists and
   the CSE itself, recommended in 2014 that information on calories,
   sugar, fat, saturated fat and salt be displayed upfront. In 2018, the
   FSSAI came up with a draft law, the Food Safety and Standards
   (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018. The draft recommended that a
   packet should have clear information on how much each nutrient, such as
   salt, sugar, contributed to the RDA. The draft said salt must be
   declared as sodium chloride for instance, and that those ingredients
   which breached the RDA should be marked in ‘red’.

   Food companies had reservations mainly because they felt ‘red’
   signified danger, fearing that this would give consumers the impression
   that they were consuming toxic food. The draft regulations never became
   law. Instead, a third committee was formed, headed by B. Sesikeran, a
   former director of the NIN. Based on this committee’s recommendations,
   a new draft (Draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display)
   Regulations, 2019) was prepared. This replaced sodium chloride with
   salt, total fat with saturated fat and total sugar with added sugar,
   which CSE says, dilutes information on the health harm posed by
   packaged foods. The new draft also exempts beverages less than 80kcal.
   In theory, a beverage can breach “added sugar” RDA without informing
   consumers as long as it is within the energy requirement. The proposed
   law allows companies three years to adjust to the new laws. However,
   the contribution of each individual nutrient to the RDA and whether it
   is breaching safe limits will have to be displayed on the front of the
   package. Though the draft regulations have been out in the public
   domain since July, it is yet to become law. The CSE’s calculations are
   based on recommended nutritional values in the draft versions of these
   laws.

Why is industry opposed to the proposed laws?

   Other than the red labels, the industry says the norms are unscientific
   and that packaged food is made to cater to the “taste” of people.
   Moreover, the packaged industry argues, immense quantities of junk food
   — think samosas or fried food sold on unregulated pushcarts — are
   consumed in the country with no check on their nutritional status and
   there is an inherent unfairness in regulating one section alone.
   Because nutritional information only guides consumers on how to
   regulate their intake, the industry feels people should be advised on
   what makes a healthy diet, the role of exercise and consuming
   appropriate amounts of food. They claim the current regulations only
   contribute to fear-mongering.

Why has not the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) moved on
the draft?

   A top FSSAI official told The Hindu that nearly 700 comments had been
   received on the 2019 draft and there were thorny issues to be resolved.
   To brand packaged food in different colours sends out the message that
   they are unsafe or “toxic”; this would be counterproductive to the
   larger aim of having a regulated but viable packaged food industry and
   people being educated about their food choices. Pawan Kumar Agarwal,
   CEO, FSSAI said he did not agree with the CSE’s analysis and that there
   was still considerable work to be done on establishing appropriate
   “thresholds” (for salt, fat, etc) for India. He said regulation is
   “inevitable” and there would be more scrutiny of nutrient levels but in
   a way that would give packaged food companies time to adapt to stricter
   norms.

What is the practice internationally?

   The CSE says that the proposed labelling regulations publish too many
   numbers and an assortment of colour codes. This could potentially
   confuse people particularly because India has a vast non-English
   speaking population. Chile, for instance, has a system where a black
   hexagon in a white border appears on the front of a package. In the
   hexagon is a phrase that says a product is “high in salt” or “high in
   trans-fat.” The more the hexagons the less desirable the product
   becomes for the consumer; surveys suggest that even children are
   becoming more conscious about the health impact of their favourite
   snacks and often influencing parents’ buying choices. Surveys
   undertaken by the WHO show that a vast majority of European countries
   have some form of front-of-pack labelling, but fewer countries have
   interpretive systems which explain the health factor of foods.
